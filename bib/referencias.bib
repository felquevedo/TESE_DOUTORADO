	abstract = {Rock mass behaviour model selection and, in particular, rock mass post-failure behaviour are key issues in analysing tunnel stability, in particular in terms of the correct application of design techniques such as the convergence-confinement method and also numerical modelling. Three different quality rock masses (good, average and poor) were defined in which simulated standard tunnels were excavated. Different behaviours - including elastic perfectly plastic, elastic brittle and three strain softening behaviours - were modelled for each type of rock mass and increasingly realistic parameters were calculated, along with the corresponding ground reaction curves. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of adequate post-failure behaviour model selection for tunnel analysis. Also assessed are the effects of the standard support and reinforcement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Armand2013,
	abstract = {Since 2000, the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) has been constructing an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) at Bure (east of the Paris Basin) to perform experiments in order to obtain in situ data necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of geological repository in the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. An important experimental program is planned to characterize the response of the rock to different drift construction methods. Before 2008, at the main level of the laboratory, most of the drifts were excavated using pneumatic hammer and supported with rock bolts, sliding steel arches and fiber shotcrete. Other techniques, such as road header techniques, stiff and flexible supports, have also been used to characterize their impacts. The drift network is developed following the in situ major stresses. The parallel drifts are separated enough so as they can be considered independently when their hydromechanical (HM) behaviors are compared. Mine-by experiments have been performed to measure the HM response of the rock and the mechanical loading applied to the support system due to the digging and after excavation. Drifts exhibit extensional (mode I) and shear fractures (modes II and III) induced by excavation works. The extent of the induced fracture networks depends on the drift orientation versus the in situ stress field. This paper describes the drift convergence and deformation in the surrounding rock walls as function of time and the impact of different support methods on the rock mass behavior. An observation based method is finally applied to distinguish the instantaneous and time-dependent parts of the rock mass deformation around the drifts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

@article{Augarde2001,
	abstract = {{This paper describes "nite element procedures that have been developed to model the ground movements that occur when a shallow tunnel is installed in a clay soil. This study is part of a wider project concerned with the development of new methods to predict the likely extent of damage to surface structures caused by nearby shallow tunnelling. This particular paper, however, is concerned only with the numerical model of tunnel installation. The structural liner is an important component of this tunnel installation model; two di!erent ways of modelling the liner (based on continuum elements and shell elements) are discussed in the paper. A test problem consisting of the installation of a lined tunnel in an elastic continuum is used to investigate the merits of these di!erent approaches. When continuum elements are used to model the liner, the numerical results agree well with an analytical solution to the problem. When shell elements are used to model the liner, however, the results were found to be signi"cantly in#uenced by the particular formulation adopted for the shell elements. Example analyses, involving incremental tunnel construction in a clay soil where the soil is modelled using a kinematic hardening plasticity model, are described. These analyses con"rm that a thin layer of continuum elements may be used, satisfactorily, to model tunnel linings in a soil}structure interaction analysis of this sort},

@article{Bernaud2009,
	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation by homogenization approach of the behaviour of a tunnel reinforced by fully grouted bolts, regarded as periodically distributed linear inclusions. Owing to the fact that a direct numerical simulation would require the ground and the reinforcing bolts be separately discretized, leading thus to a highly complex and oversized problem, a homogenization procedure is developed, aimed at circumventing the difficulties connected with the implementation of a direct simulation. The situations of reinforcement by radial bolts and horizontal anchors installed ahead the excavation face are both investigated. Considering a Drucker-Prager rock material, elastoplastic constitutive equations are formulated for the bolted rock mass regarded as a homogenized anisotropic medium at the macroscopic scale. Special attention is paid to the description of the algorithm of plastic integration involved in the finite element implementation. At this respect, closed-form expressions are derived for the stress projection onto the macroscopic yield surface. The finite element procedure is thus carried out for simulating the advancement of a bolt-supported tunnel and computing the displacements of the tunnel walls and the facing as the excavation proceeds. A parametric study, varying some relevant parameters defining the bolt reinforcement scheme, is undertaken by means of the finite element tool. The combination of rock bolting with a classical lining support system such as a shotcrete layer is also examined, thus providing some guidelines for the optimal design of the reinforcement pattern. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Boidy2002,
	abstract = {This paper presents a back analysis of the time-dependent behaviour of a monitored tunnel in Switzerland. It concerns a specific section of the Mont Terri reconnaissance gallery which was excavated in creeping rock. From a theoretical point of view, Lemaitre's viscoplastic model was implemented in the FLAC 2D finite-difference numerical code. Particular attention was paid to the stability of the numerical solution for such an explicit mode of resolution. Lemaitre model parameters were successfully fitted on creep tests and then on in situ convergence measurements after a complete numerical simulation. Based on the comparison of strain and stress measured in the lining with the calculated values, time-dependent behaviour can finally be extrapolated over a period of approximately 10 years. Scale effects between results of in situ and laboratory fittings are also discussed. The aim of these investigations is to justify the interest of Lemaitre's model for the analysis of time-dependent behaviour of underground structures over a long period of time. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Under these circumstances the construction costs may rise due to the delays in excavation time, the stabilisation and heavy support measures that need be adopted. Following a review of characterisation and modelling of time-dependent behaviour in rock, the mechanical behaviour of Clay Shales (CS), a structurally complex formation of the Apennines (Italy), is described. Then, the key factors involved in the selection of the constitutive model for CS are identified. Two constitutive models are selected and discussed and their specific material parameters determined. A case study of a large size tunnel is presented where numerical modelling by the finite difference method is carried out. The results of modelling are compared with the monitoring data in terms of radial convergence of the tunnel and extrusion of the tunnel face. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Burd2000,
	abstract = {Current practice for assessment of settlement damage to buildings due to tunnel construction usually starts with a procedure in which greenfield settlements are imposed on a structual model of the building. This process ignores the important interaction effects that the weight and stiffness of the building have on the settlements. This paper describes a threedimensional finite element analysis in which the tunnel, the soil and a building are all treated in a single analysis. Example calculations are described, and these indicate that interaction between the building and the ground can have a significant effect on the extent of the predicted damage. The performance of the building is seen to be highly dependent on whether the settlements induce a sagging or hogging mode of deformation. The analyses are used to plot contours of soil surface settlement and also expected crack patterns within the building.},

	abstract = {This paper is intended to illustrate the relationship between the Hoek-Brown parameters describing the strength of rock masses and the mechanical response of underground openings. A formulation of the elasto-plastic behavior of rock in terms of the Hoek-Brown criterion is presented. The analysis assumes that the joint system present in the rock mass has no preferred orientation so that the medium can be considered to behave as an isotropic continuum. It is shown that appropriate scaling of the Hoek-Brown parameters leads to considerable simplification in defining the elasto-plastic response of the rock mass. The classical case in which the excavation process is treated as a uniform reduction of internal pressure in symmetrically loaded cylindrical and spherical cavities is considered. Closed-form expressions are given for the extent of plastic behavior and the related stress and displacement fields. A dimensionless graphical representation of these solutions is provided that allows accurate estimates of the response of excavations in Hoek-Brown materials to be made quickly and easily. Examples are given to illustrate the use of the graphs. Illustrative applications of the derived closed-form solutions are also described. The construction of ground reaction curves for the design of cylindrical tunnels according to the convergence-confinement method and a case study of stability analysis of spherical cavities produced by underground nuclear explosions in French Polynesian atolls are discussed.},

@article{Carranza-Torres2004,
	abstract = {The Hoek-Brown failure criterion is a semi-empirical method widely used in the estimation of shear strength of rock. Among other parameters involved in this criterion, the coefficient a dictates whether the criterion applies to intact rock or rock masses (a = 0.5 for intact rock and a > 0.5 for rock masses). Most of the existing elasto-plastic solutions for tunnel problems in Hoek-Brown media consider an intact rock (i.e., a = 0.5). This is not only due to historical reasons (the failure criterion was originally developed for intact rock), but also due to the mathematical difficulties of deriving neat, closed-form expressions for the general case in which a ≥ 0.5. This paper presents a rigorous, elasto-plastic solution for the axi-symmetrical problem of excavating a circular tunnel in generalized Hoek-Brown material (a ≥ 0.5). The solution is obtained by re-writing the generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion in terms of transformed stress quantities. Application of the transformation rule described in this paper to elasto-plastic problems of excavations in generalized Hoek-Brown materials is shown to bring significant advantages in the interpretation and extrapolation of results obtained with analytical and numerical methods.},

As the tunnel excavations are undertaken at different levels, there will be an interaction which can have a significant influence on stress distribu- tions and consequently deformations within the tunnels and surface settlement. As multi-layer tunnelling is a three dimensional phenomenon in nature, 3D numerical solutions must be utilized for perpendicularly crossing tunnels at various levels. This paper reports the investigations into the changes in stress distribution, deformations and surface settlements which may be expected when the twin Tohid Tunnels pass beneath the Line 4 metro tunnel in Tehran.},

@incollection{Chan2008,
	abstract = {A numerical method for the calculation of the overall behaviour of a non-trivial three-dimensional saturated soil-structure system is presented in this paper. The numerical modelling of saturated soil is discussed in detail together with comparisons with soil-structure physical experiments performed on the centrifuge facilities at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the VELACS project.
	In order to model the saturated soil, three main components are needed for the numerical simulation and they are as follows:
	
	The establishment of an adequate mathematical framework to describe the phenomenon
	The establishment of a numerical (discrete) approximation procedure
	The establishment of an adequate constitutive relationship for the material behaviour
	The numerical procedure employs the Biot formulation as the basic mathematical framework, the Finite Element method for spatial discretisation and the Generalised Newmark scheme for time stepping [1]. The u-p formulation is used with displacement (u) and pore pressure (p) as the primary unknowns and the constitutive relationship used is the Pastor-Zienkiewicz mark III model [2].
	
	The numerical procedure is validated using Test No.12 from the VELACS [3] experiments, is a dynamic three-dimensional soil-structure interaction test with a model of a structure in the form of a block being placed on a saturated sand layer overlaid by a thin silt layer and subjected to earthquake-like base motion. The tests were performed at 100g centrifugal acceleration at Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of California, Davis [4].
	
	Very good comparisons with the results from the physical centrifuges test had been obtained. All the accelerations predicted were in good agreement with the measured values. Very good comparisons were also obtained for most of the pore water pressure transducers though in some locations, the level of excess pore pressure rise was slightly lower than that measured. Around 10cm settlement was predicted by the numerical analysis which is between the value obtained at UC Davis (9cm) and RPI (13cm). But a very wide spread of the measured vertical settlement was observed therefore the measured final settlement value may not be too trustworthy for comparison purposes however the numerical prediction correctly modelled the trend at which the settlement developed.
	
	These results confirmed that the assumptions and the approximation used in the numerical procedure are sound and further analyses on various three-dimensional examples and further investigations on the use of iterative solvers instead of the direct solver used in this study are underway.},

The case of circular tunnels is considered and the formulation of the mathematical problem is discussed. Furthermore, the creep of rock around a tunnel with nonlinear supports (called "yieldable" or "self-adapting" supports) to limit the closure of the tunnel is studied. It is shown that the ultimate ground reaction is not unique since it depends on the loading history such as excavation layout and support design. For relatively small pressures exerted by the support, it is shown that the onset of failure by dilatancy can be determined. Two kinds of solutions are given: a simplified approximate one, which is easy to apply and with which the qualitative discussion of the solution is simple and revealing, and a more rigorous general elaborate numerical solution obtained by using computer programs. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@phdthesis{Debernardi2008,
	abstract = {In the framework of Geotechnical Engineering and Rock Mechanics many tunnels are known where, even during construction, large deformations and high stresses in the lining are observed. This is often the result of squeezing behaviour. Tunnel construction in such a condition is very demanding and difficulties are met in making reliable predictions at the design stage. The selection of the most appropriate excavation-construction method to be adopted (i.e. mechanized tunnelling versus conventional tunnelling) is highly problematic and uncertain. The present thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the squeezing behaviour of tunnels with a major interest on the time dependent response. The research is focused on the experimental investigation of time dependent characteristics of weak rock at the laboratory scale and on the formulation of a new constitutive model (SHELVIP) to be used in design practice. The considered case of study is the Saint Martin La Porte access adit, along the Torino-Lyon Base Tunnel, which experienced very important squeezing problems during excavation. Following the introduction of the various time dependent phenomena that are known to exist for soils/rocks and that are unanimously accepted by the geotechnical community, the thesis examines the constitutive models that have been proposed so far to capture the time dependent behaviour. The bibliographic study highlights that only few models can reproduce satisfactorily all the features of the time dependent behaviour of weak rocks involved in tunnel excavation, with a simple formulation to be used in design practice. This observation led to the study of the peculiar characteristics of weak rocks and to the formulation of a novel viscoplastic constitutive model. The availability of rock samples obtained from the Saint Martin La Porte tunnel and the peculiar characteristics of the material has determined the choice of coal as the rock material of interest for the present study. An experimental program has been performed on this material, involving the determination of the physical properties and mineralogical composition, in conjunction with oedometer tests, direct shear tests and triaxial tests, performed by using two advanced laboratory equipments: the High Pressure Triaxial Apparatus (HPTA) and the High Pressure Back Pressure Shear Apparatus (HPBPSA). Particular attention has been posed on the deformability, strength characteristics, and time dependent behaviour. The results obtained highlight that most of the time dependent characteristics of coal follow in line the experimental evidences reported in literature. Only few aspects differ significantly. These observations form the background for the formulation of the new constitutive model proposed. The SHELVIP (Stress Hardening ELastic VIscous Plastic) model, a new viscoplastic constitutive law, has been developed to incorporate the most im- portant features of behaviour observed in tunnels excavated in severe to very severe squeezing conditions in a simple, but complete, manner. This model couples the elastoplastic and time dependent behaviour by using a plastic yield surface, as frequently adopted in tunnel design analysis, and the definition of a state of overstress referred to a viscoplastic yield surface. The model has been formulated in all its detailed aspects. The related analytical closed-form solution for representing triaxial creep deformations has been developed. By observing the behaviour of the model with reference to classical time dependent tests, is should be noted that the SHELVIP model can reproduce almost all the important aspects of time dependency of soils/rocks. Finally, the new model has been implemented into the finite difference code FLAC, in order to allow to perform numerical analyses of geotechnical problems. The SHELVIP model has been calibrated by using the laboratory tests performed on coal specimens. The model is shown to fit very satisfactorily the experimental results of creep and stress relaxation triaxial tests. In the final part of the thesis a series of numerical analyses, which have been carried out using the newly developed SHELVIP model on a representative section of the Saint Martin La Porte tunnel with the intent to evaluate the ability of the model to describe the squeezing conditions with reference to a real case study, are described. If the results of the numerical analyses are compared with the monitoring convergence data, radial and longitudinal displacements, it is possible to state that the agreement of the numerical results with the mean monitored data is excellent, notwithstanding the scattering of the monitoring data due to the heterogeneity and anisotropy of the rock mass. Also the results of stress distribution around the tunnel perimeter are satisfactory and reliable. It is possible to conclude that the SHELVIP model can be used with confidence in order to reproduce by numerical analysis the behaviour of tunnels under severe squeezing conditions. Further developments are needed and some open questions remain to be addressed for the study of the time dependent behaviour of weak rocks in relation to tunnel excavation, in particular for the assessment of the stability conditions of both the face and the heading, the timely installation of the tunnel support, and the excavation method to be adopted.},

An analytical approach to the viscoplastic behaviour of a rock mass around a deep tunnel in different stages of a simplified life cycle is presented. The viscoplasticity is modelled by means of a simple (linear) Norton-Hoff's law. First, the solution for a dry rock mass is presented, then an extension to a particular case of a porous saturated rock mass with a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 is examined. Some numerical examples are carried out to show the consistency and relevance of the solutions. Parametric studies illustrate the influence of key parameters such as rock mass viscosity and time of lining emplacement. This analytical approach constitutes a useful reference to test more complex numerical simulation and makes it possible to obtain practical estimations of the poromechanical behaviour of underground structures.},

@article{Detournay1987,
	abstract = {This paper describes a two-dimensional elastoplastic model of a long, cylindrical cavity in an infinite rock mass subject to non-hydrostatic far-field stress loading. The rock is assumed to behave as an elastoplastic dilatant material that is characterized by a cohesive frictional yield strength. The analysis is based on a solution of the elastoplastic interface that is applicable when the underground cavity becomes completely surrounded by a zone of failed rock, and for stress conditions for which the problem is statically determined. This latter restriction limits the range of deviation from a hydrostatic stress condition that can be analyzed with the model. The stress and displacement field induced by excavation unloading of the cavity is determined on the basis of a proportional load trajectory that involves a monotonic decrease of internal pressure in the cavity. For this particular load history, the elastoplastic boundary grows in a self-similar manner. This allows both displacement and stress field to be calculated in a unit plane, defined by dividing all physical lengths by the characteristic size of the plastic zone. This feature of the solution eliminates the need to solve continuously for the stress and displacement during the evolution of the plastic region. Explicit formulation of the stress field in the plane and of the displacement field in the elastic region is provided; determination of the displacement field in the elastic region is obtained numerically using the method of characteristics. Some important specific results are discussed; a single parameter, the "obliquity" (m), defined as the ratio between the stress deviator at infinity and the yield limit, is found to control the shape of the failed rock region and the uneven closure of the cavity. It is found also that the direction of maximum closure may become perpendicular to the maximum far-field compressive stress under some loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION The stress redistribution accompanying the excavation of a deep tunnel may induce failure of the rock. The role of the support system is to Control the extent of the failed region and hence to limit closure of the t,,-nel within an allowable amount. In such circumstances, the design of the support system is generally based on the Ground Reaction Curve (GRC). The GRC is the relationship between the support pressure and the induced displacement at the tunnel wall for a circular tunnel under hydrostatic loading. In the calculation of the GRC (see Brown et al. (1983) for an exhaustive list of reference), the rock is generally treated as an elastoplastic material characterized by cohesive-frictional yield strength and by dilatancy during plastic deformation. A recent analytical development (Detournay, 1983) has allowed the generalization of the 0RC concept for some cases of non-hydrostatic in-situ stress fields (Detournay and Fairhurst, 1982). As an application of that development, this paper describes design charts that provide powerful means of performing parametric analysis for tunnels subject to non-hydrostatic loading. BACKGROUND The in-situ stress in a plane perpendicular to the tunnel axis can be decomposed into mean and deviatoric components, Po and So (see Fig. 1). Since it is assumed that the rock is characterized by a Mohr-Coulomb yield strength, the deviatoric invariant So must be less th},

	abstract = {Spalling and strain bursting has long been recognized as a mechanism of failure in deep underground mines in hard rock and in deep infrastructure tunnels. The latter is a significant growth industry, particularly in Europe where subalpine base tunnels in excess of 10 m wide and dozens of kilometres long are being driven by tunnel boring machine (TBM) through alpine terrain at depths greater than 2 km. In more massive granitoid or gneissic ground, these tunnels have experienced significant spalling damage. En route to a practical predictive technique for this condition, the author utilizes a number of analytical and micromechanical tools to validate a simple empirical predictive model for tunnel spall initiation. The true nature of damage and of yield, as the result of extensile damage accumulation, in hard rocks is examined using these tools. Based on the resultant conceptual model, the author expands on the empirical damage threshold, using a spalling limit to differentiate stress paths that lead to crack propagation and spalling from those that incur stable microdamage prior to conventional shear failure at higher relative confinements. Finally, the composite and robust in situ yield model is applied to nonlinear modelling for support design.},

	abstract = {The increase in transportation in large cities makes it necessary to construct of twin tunnels at shallow depths. Thus, the prediction of the influence of a new tunnel construction on an already existing one plays a key role in the optimal design and construction of close parallel shield tunnels in order to avoid any damage to the existing tunnel during and after excavation of the new tunnel.Most of the reported cases in the literature on parallel mechanized excavation of twin tunnels have focused on the effects of the ground condition, tunnel size, tunnel depth, surface loads, and relative position between the two tunnels on tunnel behaviour. The numerical investigation performed in this study, using the FLAC3D finite difference element programme, has made it possible to include the influence of the construction process between the two tunnels. The structural forces induced in both tunnels and the development of the displacement field in the surrounding ground have been highlighted.The results of the numerical analysis have indicated a great impact of a new tunnel construction on an existing tunnel. The influence of the lagged distance between the two tunnels faces has also been highlighted. Generally, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels causes smaller structural forces and lining displacements than those induced in the case of twin tunnels excavated at a large lagged distance. However, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels could result in a higher settlement above the two tunnels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This variation depends on the advance of the tunnel and on the rheological behavior of the hosting rock mass. In this paper, the effect of creep, in the response of the tunnel is discussed. The objective of the paper is to predict time-dependent displacement of the tunnel wall, after stopping the excavation or after installing the support system. The rock mass is assumed to be isotropic and homogenous and incompressible. The tunnel is assumed to be circular and driven in a hydrostatic stress field. The rate of excavation is considered to be infinitely large. The Burger's body which is able to model the primary and secondary creep regions of the rock mass is applied. In such a condition, an analytical solution for predicting time-dependent deformation of tunnel wall is derived. Thereafter, the application of the proposed solution is illustrated through three examples. The examples are analyzed numerically using the finite difference code FLAC. The results obtained from numerical analyses show proper agreement to the results of proposed solution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The analysis of shallow tunnels is necessarily related to the study of the excavation influence on the ground surface. As the excavation proceeds, surface settlements are expected to be generated, forming the so-called settlement basin. Thereby, its correct evaluation is important since these movements could create disturbances in surrounding structures. Estimation of tunneling-induced ground movements can be done by analytical, empirical, and numerical methods and, currently, the best assessment of tunneling process consists of finite element modeling. The current paper presents a numerical model elaborated in the software ANSYS with the aim to evaluate the surface settlements induced by tunneling. The 3D finite element model concerns soil and lining elements, using the activation and deactivation tool to simulate the excavation and lining placement. To perform the analysis, the soil mass was represented by a plastic model using the Drucker Prager criterion and the concrete lining is considered elastic. Five reported cases of real tunnels (Heathrow Express, Green Park, Barcelona Subway, Bras{\'{i}}lia Subway, and S{\~{a}}o Paulo Para{\'{i}}so tunnels) are simulated to validate the model with analytical and experimental solutions.},

@article{Guayacan-Carrillo2016,
	abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the convergence measurements in drifts of the Underground Research Laboratory (URL) of the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra), excavated in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. These measurements show an anisotropic closure, which depends on the drift orientations with respect to the horizontal in situ stresses. This anisotropic character of the deformation is taken into account by assuming that the drifts section evolves following an elliptical shape. The characteristics of the deformed elliptical section are evaluated following the methodology proposed by Vu et al. (Rock Mech Rock Eng 46:231–246, 2013). Then, using the semi-empirical law proposed by Sulem et al. (Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24:145–154, 1987), the convergence evolution is fitted independently for each axis of the ellipse. This method allows to distinguish two effects: the face advance and the time-dependent behavior of the ground. The results for the two drift orientations (along the major horizontal stress and perpendicular to it) show very close values for the parameters describing the time-dependent properties of the ground, the distance of influence of the face, and the extent of the decompressed zone around the drift. Finally, the model is validated by keeping these parameters as constants and by simulating the convergence data on a new drift. It is shown that with a period of about 40 days of convergence monitoring, the model can provide valuable insights for predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term.},

It is shown that consideration of the actual advancing face condition, lining placement delay and the use of a soft backing can significantly reduce the design stresses developed in the liner.

The stability and efficiency of the algorithms have been investigated in relation to two types of stiffness operators, namely, the\nconsistent elastoplastic modulus and the continuum elastoplastic modulus, and two types of stresses prediction strategies, namely, path independent (based on stresses at previous step) and path dependent (based on stresses at the previous iteration). The numerical experiments show that CPPM working with a consistent elastoplastic modulus and a path independent strategy gives the best performance. It was also observed, however, that the CPA with a continuum elastoplastic modulus and path dependent strategy was quite stable and efficient. This latter observation has implications for advanced constitutive modeling since CPA with a continuum elastoplastic modulus avoids the need for evaluation of the second derivatives of the plastic potential function, making it easier to deal with complicated yield surfaces.},

@techreport{ITASCA2006,
	abstract = {1 CREEP MATERIAL MODELS 1.1 Introduction This FLAC option can be used to simulate the behavior of materials that exhibit creep-i.e., time-dependent material behavior. Six creep models have been implemented in FLAC. These are: (1) a classical viscoelastic model; (2) a two-component power law; (3) a reference creep formulation (the WIPP model) for nuclear-waste isolation studies; (4) a Burger-creep viscoplastic model combining the Burger's creep model and the Mohr-Coulomb model; (5) a WIPP-creep viscoplastic model combining the WIPP model and the Drucker-Prager model; and (6) a crushed-salt constitutive model. The first model is the classical formulation known as the Maxwell substance. The second model can be used for mining applications (e.g., salt or potash mining), and the third model is commonly used in thermomechanical analyses associated with studies for the underground isolation of nuclear waste in salt. The fourth model expands on the first model, and also includes a Kelvin and a Mohr-Coulomb component. The fifth model is a variation of the third model, and includes a Drucker-Prager plasticity component. The sixth model is also a variation of the third, and includes volumetric and deviatoric compaction behavior. Descriptions of these models and their implementations are provided in this section.* In addition, it is possible for users to write their own creep constitutive models using FISH. An example FISH function which represents a Burger's creep model is included. The FISH version of the Burger-creep viscoplastic model is also provided. * The data files in this chapter are all created in a text editor. The files are stored in the directory "ITASCA\FLAC600\Creep" with the extension ".DAT." A project file is also provided for each example. In order to run an example and compare the results to plots in this chapter, open a project file in the GIIC by clicking on the File / Open Project menu item and selecting the project file name (with extension ".PRJ"). Click on the Project Options icon at the top of the Project Tree Record, select Rebuild unsaved states, and the example data file will be run and plots created. FLAC Version 6.0},

@article{Jing2003,
	abstract = {The purpose of this review paper is to present the techniques, advances, problems and likely future developments in numerical modelling for rock mechanics. Such modelling is essential for studying the fundamental processes occurring in rocks and for rock engineering design. The review begins by explaining the special nature of rock masses and the consequential difficulties when attempting to model their inherent characteristics of discontinuousness, anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inelasticity. The rock engineering design backdrop to the review is also presented. The different types of numerical models are outlined in Section 2, together with a discussion on how to obtain the necessary parameters for the models. There is also discussion on the value that is obtained from the modelling, especially the enhanced understanding of those mechanisms initiated by engineering perturbations. In Section 3, the largest section, states-of-the-art and advances associated with the main methods are presented in detail. In many cases, for the model to adequately represent the rock reality, it is necessary to incorporate couplings between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. The physical processes and the equations characterizing the coupled behaviour are included in Section 4, with an illustrative example and discussion on the likely future development of coupled models. Finally, in Section 5, the advances and outstanding issues in the subject are listed and in Section 6 there are specific recommendations concerning quality control, enhancing confidence in the models, and the potential future developments. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The majority of researches were conducted with the assumption that the behavior of the surrounding rock masses is viscoelastic. In this paper, an analytical solution is proposed for circular tunnels under hydrostatic stress field, whose surrounding rock mass is isotropic, homogenous, obeying viscous elastic-plastic constitutive model. It is assumed that the rate of excavation is infinitely large. Therefore, the solution is proposed for unlined tunnels when the advance of tunnel face is halted, or after lining installation when the tunnel face is far from the studied section. The results were compared with those predicted by finite difference numerical model which exhibited a good agreement for both lined and unlined tunnels, except for large times where numerical model results slightly exceed the values predicted by the proposed solutions for lined tunnels.},

ABSTRACT. In this paper, a tool for better controlling the use of constitutive models in numerical methods in geotechnical engineering is proposed. For this purpose a constitutive model based on CJS model is developed. This model is hierarchically composed of several levels of constitutive modelling, respectively from a simple level to a more complex level. The transition from one level to another is easy in operating only over some constants of the model. The strategy of identification and physical meanings for all of the constants are clearly defined. In order to validate the different levels of the model, the results of homogeneous drained and undrained tests, in the same way as boundary problems concerning pressuremeter and tunnel are presented and discussed.

@article{Manh2015,
	abstract = {Most of the viscoplastic models used to describe the constitutive behavior of squeezing grounds assume isotropic deformation. However, it is commonly observed that squeezing behavior is characterized not only by large time-dependent but also often by anisotropic deformations. This study uses a semi-empirical approach based on the analysis of convergence measurements and a numerical model that takes into account the time-dependent and the anisotropic response of the rock mass to investigate the squeezing behavior of the Saint-Martin-la-Porte access gallery, excavated within the Lyon–Turin railway project. We first show how the semi-empirical convergence law of Sulem et al. (Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24(3):155–164, 1987a; Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24(3):145–154, 1987b) can be extended to anisotropic tunnel closure by considering an elliptical deformation of the rock mass and by fitting the convergence data along the principal axes of deformation. A new anisotropic time-dependent constitutive model is then proposed. This model includes ubiquitous joints of specific orientation embedded in an isotropic viscoplastic medium. This model is implemented in FLAC3D and numerical simulations are performed to back-analyze the anisotropic closure of the Saint-Martin-la-Porte access gallery. An efficient two-step procedure for calibrating the model parameters is proposed: the parameters of the isotropic solid matrix are first estimated by performing axisymmetric numerical simulations. The parameters of the ubiquitous joints are then calibrated by performing 3D computations. It is shown that the numerical results reproduce very well the convergence measurements of the studied sections of Saint-Martin-la-Porte gallery.},

@article{Manchao2015,
	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing worldwide in mining and civil engineering. There have been several accidents that resulted in delays, cost overruns, some with more severe consequences. To help minimize these accidents, it is necessary to assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction and exploration. A particular type of accident, or undesirable event, which can occur during tunnel construction and operation, is associated with the occurrence of excessive deformations occurring inside the tunnel. This can happen due to deficient design, construction defects, and high in situ stresses or due to specific swelling and squeezing grounds. Deep coal mines where large deformations can occur during and after excavations due to the soft properties of the rock and the high in situ stresses, are particularly vulnerable to this type of event. The associated non-linear problems are related with geomechanical behavior of the rock mass, changes in the geometry of cavities and in some cases with developing surface contacts due to large strains. In this paper, the phenomena involved in large material deformations are analyzed in detail and the basic equations for the Chen's large deformation theory are presented. The application of an FEM based method to simulate large material deformations, the Material Point Method (MPM) to the simulation of large deformation that occurs in tunnels when failure occurs, is also described. An application of MPM to the Jiahe Coal Mine, in China is presented, and the numerical results obtained with MPM compared with solutions using Chen's large deformation theory. Safety considerations about the excessive deformation scenario in tunnels are drawn and a risk assessment methodology with special use of Bayesian networks is proposed. A simplified schematic example was presented for two case scenarios.},

@article{Martin2003,
	abstract = {When the stress-induced risks to a projects warrant it, in situ stress must be measured. However, as the stress-induced risks increase, i.e., the stress magnitudes approach the rock mass strength, the confidence in commonly used stress measurement techniques decrease. The design of underground openings at depth requires knowledge of the in situ stress state, yet it is for these design conditions where our confidence in stress measurement techniques is at its lowest. To quantify the stress state for these conditions, elements of the Observational Design Method have to be used. These elements rely on the development of a geological site model, documented observations of over stressed rock in pillars or near the boundary of underground openings, and iterative two- and three-dimensional numerical modelling calibrated with observations. Examples are provided to illustrate how the philosophy of Observational Design Method can be used to infer the in situ stress state. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Mesri1981,
	abstract = {Shear stress-strain-time models for soils were examined in terms of undrained triaxial compression tests, with pore water pressure measurement, using reconstituted specimens of kaolinite and Cucaracha shale. Multiple-step constant load and constant rate of deformation tests were performed. The testing variables included final equal all-round consolidation pressure (100-800 lb/in2), overconsolidation ratio (1-8) and the magnitude of the first load increment (20-82% in terms of shear stress level). Additional constant load test data reported in the literature were analysed. The parameters of an exponential stress-strain model were expressed and interpreted in terms of the parameters of the hyperbolic stress-strain model. The parameters of both models can be expressed in terms of the undrained modulus to undrained shear strength ratio Eu/su and the axial strain at failure $\epsilon$f. The creep parameter $\lambda$ which controls time or strain rate effects was correlated with Eu/su. It appears that any soil has a potential total strain at any shear stress level, and that $\lambda$ is directly related to the magnitude of the remaining strain. A large value of Eu/su means a small strain at any small time. Therefore as Eu/su increases, the remaining strain and thus $\lambda$ increase. Alternative combinations of the hyperbolic stress-strain and either power strain-time or power strain-strain rate relationships are suggested as possible creep models for the analysis of field problems and interpretation of laboratory tests. {\textcopyright} 1981, Thomas Telford Ltd.

@article{Moran1990,
	abstract = {Some constitutive and computational aspects of finite deformation plasticity are discussed. Attention is restricted to multiplicative theories of plasticity, in which the deformation gradients are assumed to be decomposable into elastic and plastic terms. It is shown by way of consistent linearization of momentum balance that geometric terms arise which are associated with the motion of the intermediate configuration and which in general render the tangent operator non‐symmetric even for associated plastic flow. Both explicit (i.e. no equilibrium iteration) and implicit finite element formulations are considered. An assumed strain formulation is used to accommodate the near‐incompressibility associated with fully developed isochoric plastic flow. As an example of explicit integration, the rate tangent modulus method is reviewed in some detail. An implicit scheme is derived for which the consistent tangents, resulting in quadratic convergence of the equilibrium iterations, can be written out in closed form for arbitrary material models. All the geometrical terms associated with the motion of the intermediate configuration and the treatment of incompressibility are given explicitly. Examples of application to void growth and coalescence and to crack tip blunting are developed which illustrate the performance of the implicit method.

	abstract = {The understanding of the mechanism of tunnel convergence is essential for designing the required support of a tunnel. To take various time effects on the convergence-confinement relation into account, it is possible to correlate different factors with time, then to deal with their collective effects. As a result, the time-dependent tunnel deformation problem can be modelled as a viscoelastic problem. The solutions of various viscoelastic models can be obtained from the corresponding elastic solution based on a standard procedure. In this paper, a hierarchical approach, which considers: (1) the rheological properties of a rock mass; (2) the advancement of the tunnel; and (3) the tunnel-support interaction is proposed to model the excavation/construction process during the tunnelling in a rock mass with rheological properties. The time-dependent factors considered in the proposed model are discussed. Subsequently, the theoretical formulation of this model is developed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

This is particularly true for tunnels excavated in soft rock which could sustain large deformations. In this context, the forecast and the assessment of the behaviour of the rock mass during the tunnel's construction stages, as well as in the long term, require numerical modelling with the use of appropriate constitutive models. In this paper, current models which are based on the viscoplasticity coupled to the damage theory are presented. They enable the computing of creep strains, stress relaxation and possibly, time at failure, if the damage process of the rock is taken into account. Thereafter a numerical modelling of an underground gallery is presented based on this model. The role of the main construction characteristics, such as the rate of excavation and the delay for support installations, is finally discussed.},

I t is well-known that in many practical problems, the actual behaviour of a material is governed by plastic as well as by rheologic effects. It can even be said that for many important structural materials, rheologic effects are more pronounced after the plastic state has been reached. Every material shows more or less pronounced viscous properties. In some problems, the influence of viscous properties of the material may be negligible, while in others, it may be essential. Both sciences—plasticity and rheology—are concerned with the description of important mechanical properties of structural materials. Each of them has created its own methods of investigation and has developed within the framework of certain assumptions which, unfortunately, cannot always be satisfied in reality. The results of rheology are confined to cases where plastic strain is of no decisive importance.},

	abstract = {A viscoelastic analysis using the hyperbolic and power creep laws is developed for prediction of time-dependent closure of circular tunnels. Effect of support types and installation location in accordance with the convergence confinement method are incorporated in the analysis. The hyperbolic creep law is found to be more practical for simulation of closure response of squeezing ground than the power creep law because it is capable of modeling ground yielding around the tunnel when value of R f close to 1.0 is used. A parametric study is performed using the hyperbolic law and the results are discussed. Predicted tunnel closure was compared with the monitoring data from a number of tunnels and they were found in good agreement. It is found that the closure and support yielding time are most sensitive to the hyperbolic parameter E u I($\sigma$ 1 -$\sigma$ 3 ) f and creep parameter $\lambda$. The values of E u I($\sigma$1-$\sigma$3) f of 200-250 and $\lambda$ of 0.03-0.15 are found to be reasonable for most ground that exhibit squeezing. The analysis is useful in predicting time-dependent closure and support load for tunnels in both rocks and soils. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

These solutions offer a more comprehensive framework for understanding the distribution of ground movements than widely used empirical functions. Analytical solutions for the displacement field within the ground mass are obtained for two basic modes of deformation corresponding to uniform convergence and ovalization at the wall of a circular tunnel cavity, based on the assumption of linear, elastic soil behavior. Deformation fields based on the superposition of fundamental, singularity solutions are shown to differ only slightly from analyses that consider the physical dimensions of the tunnel cavity, except in the case of very shallow tunnels. This work demonstrates a simplified method to account for soil plasticity in the analyses and illustrate closed-form solutions for a three-dimensional (3D) tunnel heading. A companion paper describes applications of these analyses to interpret field measurements of ground response to tunneling. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {An advancing tunnel in deep saturated ground induces coupled interactions between transient fluid flow and deformation that affect the hydro-mechanical (H-M) response of the ground surrounding the excavation. The use of the convergence-confinement method (CCM) to simplify this three-dimensional (3-D) coupled problem into a 2-D plane strain model must then account for this transient coupling effect. Similarly, the induced radial displacement of the tunnel, commonly represented as the longitudinal displacement profile (LDP), will also be influenced by this time-dependent coupled interaction. This study investigates the effect of the transient H-M interaction on the practical implementation of the CCM and the LDP of an advancing tunnel in deep saturated ground. The tunnel is represented by a 2-D axisymmetric coupled H-M model that is built into the computer program Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) and is subjected to an isotropic in situ stress field. First, the study analyzes the induced pore pressure and deformation behavior during the excavation and standstill periods. Second, to account for the transient coupling effect, this study proposes: (1) nonlinear unloading factors for estimating excavation-induced pore pressure changes in CCM and (2) new LDP equations for predicting transient radial displacements along the axis of the tunnel. The resulting relationships from the two propositions are normalized, and thus, they should be applicable to other tunnel depths as well.},

@article{Purwodihardjo2005,
	abstract = {Monitoring of the progressive convergence of a tunnel shows that deformations occurring in the soil surrounding a tunnel exhibit a strong evolution with time. This time-dependent behaviour can be linked to three essential factors: the distance from the point of interest to the working face over time, the distance of unsupported tunnel to the working face and the viscous properties of the soil. The objective of this paper is to propose a constitutive model of the time-dependent behaviour of soil which has been developed within the framework of elastoplasticity-viscoplasticity and critical state soil mechanics. The consideration of viscoplastic characteristic sets the current model apart from the CJS (Cambou, Jafari and Sidoroff) model as the basic elastoplastic model, and introduces an additional viscous mechanism. The evolution of the viscous yield surface is governed by a particular hardening called 'viscous hardening with a bounding surface. The proposed constitutive model has been applied in the analysis of tunnelling. Two kinds of numerical calculations have been used in the analysis, axisymmetric analysis and plane strain analysis. Monitoring of the progressive convergence of a tunnel conducted in the railway tunnel of Tartaiguille (France), has been used to describe the calculation procedure proposed and the capability of the model. The finite difference software, fast Lagrangian analysis of continua (FLAC), has been used for the numerical simulation of the problems. The comparison of results shows that the observed deformations could have been reasonably predicted by using the constitutive model and calculation strategy proposed.

This paper advances a number of theory-based decision aids, which will support rapid, initial assessments to be made of thrust force requirements. A comprehensive parametric study has been carried out using the finite element method and, based on the numerical results, dimensionless design nomograms have been worked out that cover the relevant range of material constants, in situ stress and TBM characteristics. The nomograms make it possible to assess the feasibility of a TBM drive in a given geotechnical situation and to evaluate potential design measures or operational measures such as reductions in shield length, the installation of a higher thrust force, increases in the overcut or the lubrication of the shield surface, thus making a valuable contribution to the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Squeezing ground represents a challenging operating environment as it may slow down or obstruct TBM operation. Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of one or two decimetres may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. This paper sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions; secondly to analyse the factors governing TBM performance by means of a structured examination of the multiple interfaces and interactions between ground, tunnelling equipment and support; and thirdly to provide a critical review of the technical options existing or proposed for coping with squeezing ground in mechanized tunnelling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The numerical approach consists of a tunnel axis in an elasto-viscoplastic rock mass and a concrete elastic lining. This study emphasizes some important factors that influence the tunnel calculation, such as tunnel face, history of excavation phases, timing of the lining mounting, lining stiffness, and depth of the tunnel. The analytical approach is based on the determination and integration of the rock-lining interface differential equation.

@article{Sakurai1978,
	abstract = {The pressure acting on tunnel support structures generally increases with lapse in time. The pressure increase may be caused by not only the time-dependent mechanical properties of the underground medium, but also by the progression of the tunnel face. In order to clarify these two effects, three- dimensional analysis is required. In this study, however, a method which takes into account the three-dimensional effects of the tunnel face progression in two-dimensional plane strain analyses is proposed by introducing the ‘equivalent initial stress'. The proposed method can be easily applied to time-dependent analyses of the behaviour of tunnel support structures installed in a visco-elastic medium. The tunnels considered here are circular in shape, being driven in homogeneous isotropic linear visco-elastic media having hydrostatic initial stresses. In the first part of this paper, detailed discussions of the proposed equivalent initial stress are given. The second deals with the mathematical formulations for obtaining closed-form solutions for the pressure acting on tunnel support structures. In the third, numerical results and discussions are given, and special attention is paid to the effects of both the time-dependent mechanical properties of the material and the tunnel face progression. Finally, the theoretical results obtained here are utilized for inter- pretation of field measurements.},

In addition it becomes increasingly common to use results from numerical analysis as basis for designing the support measures for the tunnel. When doing so, the strongly nonlinear material behaviour of shotcrete, namely the increase of stiffness and strength with time, should be taken into account, in particular when the excavated cross section is subdivided in several construction stages involving temporary shotcrete structures with high stress concentrations near corners. In this paper a new constitutive model for shotcrete is applied in the numerical analysis of a complex underground railway station. It could be shown that significant differences in lining stresses are obtained when employing the newly developed constitutive model for shotcrete. However, the overall deformation behaviour is not significantly influenced by the shotcrete model},

The stresses obtained from the model are shown to be an average fit to stress measurement data. The factor responsible for causing higher values of the horizontal-to-vertical stress ratio k nearer to the surface is shown to be the earth's curvature. The model and its one variation which considers transverse isotropy indicate that the horizontal stress depends on the elastic modulus measured in the horizontal direction. An equation is proposed for obtaining the horizontal stress in soft, jointed or generally weaker formations when stress measurement is carried out in competent rocks at the same location. It is shown that stress values measured in one rock cannot be extrapolated to other rocks in the same area if their elastic moduli are different. The dependence of horizontal stress on elastic modulus is corroborated by 46 published stress measurement data and average prediction equations for horizontal stress and k are proposed in terms of the elastic modulus. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Shrestha2015,
	abstract = {Most of the analytical approaches that are available for assessing plastic deformation in tunnels that pass through weak, schistose, and foliated rock masses assume an isostatic stress state. However, in situ stresses are seldom isostatic in a tunnel passing through a varying rock overburden. The work reported here analyzed the effect of stress anisotropy on the magnitude of plastic deformation in the Kaligandaki headrace tunnel in the Nepal Himalaya, where extensive deformation monitoring plans were implemented during tunnel excavation. Recorded tunnel deformation, mapped geological information, lab-tested rock mechanical properties, and an approach reported by Hoek and Marinos (Tunn Tunn Int 32(11):45–51, 2000) were used to estimate rock mass parameters. The convergence confinement method (Carranza-Torres and Fairhurst, Tunn Undergr Space Technol 15(2):187–213, 2000) was used to assess the effective support pressure for the known tunnel deformations of 77 tunnel sections assuming an isostatic stress state. Numerical modeling was carried out to assess the effect of stress anisotropy on tunnel deformation. The analysis indicated that CCM overestimates the magnitude of tunnel deformation. This may be explained by the fact that CCM applies for a circular tunnel in the isostatic stress state, which is seldom the case. Actual measured deformations were calibrated using numerical modeling to develop equations that may be used to estimate the plastic deformation of tunnels that are subjected to stress anisotropy. However, it should be emphasized that the proposed equations are based on the data records for a single tunnel, so further validation will be needed using data records of other well-monitored tunnel projects.},

	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing world wide. Although the majority of tunnel construction projects have been completed safely, there have been several incidents that have resulted in delays, cost overruns, and sometimes more significant consequences such as injury and loss of life. To help eliminate these accidents, it is necessary to systematically assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction. In order to better understand the conditions under which accidents occur, a database of 204 tunnel construction accidents was assembled. This is the most comprehensive database known to date. The database was analyzed to better understand the causes of accidents. Influence diagrams were constructed containing the main factors, and the interactions between them. These served as the basis of the risk assessment methodology presented in this work. The risk assessment methodology consists of combining a geologic prediction model that allows one to predict geology ahead of the tunnel construction, with a decision support model that allows one to choose amongst different construction strategies the one that leads to minimum risk. The geologic prediction model is based on Bayesian networks because of their ability to combine domain knowledge with data, encode dependencies among variables, and their ability to learn causal relationships.},

@phdthesis{Spackova2012,
	abstract = {Estimates of uncertainties and risks of the construction process are essential information for decision-making in infrastructure projects. The construction process is affected by different types of uncertainties. We can distinguish between the common variability of the construction process and the uncertainty on occurrence of extraordinary events, also denoted as failures of the construction process. In tunnel construction, a significant part of the uncertainty results from the unknown geotechnical conditions. The construction performance is further influenced by human and organizational factors, whose effect is not known in advance. All these uncertainties should be taken into account when modelling the uncertainty and risk of the tunnel construction. For reliable predictions, it is essential to realistically estimate the parameters of the probabilistic model. At present, such estimates mostly rely on expert judgement. However, these can be strongly biased and unreliable. Therefore, the expert estimates should be supported by analysis of data from previous projects. This thesis attempts to address these issues. First, it introduces a simple probabilistic model for the estimation of the delay due to occurrence of construction failures. The model is applied to a case study, which demonstrates, how the probabilistic estimate of construction delay can be used for assessing the risk and for making decisions. Second, advanced model including both the common variability and construction failures using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is presented. This model takes over some modelling procedures from existing models but it extends the scope of the modelled uncertainties. The model is applied to two case studies for the estimation of tunnel construction time. It is demonstrated, how observations from the tunnel construction process can be included to continuously update the prediction of excavation time. Third, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the proposed DBN is developed. A modification to the existing Frontier algorithm is suggested, denoted as modified Frontier algorithm. This new algorithm is efficient for evaluating DBNs with cumulative variables. Fourth, performance data from tunnels constructed in the past are analysed. The data motivates the development of a novel combined probability distribution to describe the excavation performance. In addition, the probability of construction failure and the delay caused by such failures is estimated using databases available in the literature. Additionally, a brief database of tunnel projects and tunnel construction failures from the Czech Republic is compiled. The database includes basic information on all tunnels, which have been constructed in the Czech Republic since 1989. The database of failures, which occurred in the analysed tunnels, contains 17 events, mostly cave-in collapses. The models presented in this thesis are applied to the estimation of tunnel construction time. The construction costs can be assessed analogously by replacing the time variables with cost variables. The costs can also be modelled as a function of the construction time. The statistical analysis of data presented in the thesis provides a valuable input for probabilistic prediction of construction time in infrastructure projects. The results of the case studies seem to realistically reflect the uncertainty of the construction time estimates.},

	abstract = {The visco-plastic behaviour of rocks plays a relevant role in the tunnelling works, especially for deep tunnels subjected to large initial stresses for which squeezing conditions may develop. A rheological model is discussed that accounts for visco-elastic (primary) and visco-plastic (sec-ondary) contributions to rock creep. The effects of tertiary creep are included in the model by way of a gradual mechanical damage governed by the cumulated visco-plastic strains. The parameters of the intact rock are first identified based on laboratory test results presented in the literature. Then, after scaling them to those of the rock mass, the potential applicability of the model is tested through axisymmetric and plane strain finite element analyses of the full face excavation of a deep circular tunnel. The results are discussed with particular reference to the short term redistribution of stresses around the opening and to its convergence. The analyses show the relevant influence of tertiary creep on the tunnel closure. In addition, those based on an axisymmetric scheme turn out to be crucial for the correct long term prediction of the interaction between the rock mass and the supporting structure of the opening.},

It can thus be used for ‘self-correcting' small strain solutions, removing the need for large strain elasto-plastic analyses at least at the preliminary design stage and quantifying a hitherto unknown error caused by disregarding the geometric non-linearity. The proposed relationship can be proved rigorously for the plane strain rotationally symmetric ground response problem with a general elasto-plastic constitutive law with or without dilatancy and hardening. Numerical analyses of characteristic two- and three-dimensional excavation problems show that this relationship is generally applicable, irrespective of the in situ stress state and the tunnel geometry.

	abstract = {The main factors for the observed time dependency in tunnel construction are due to the sequence of excavation, the number of liners and their times of installation and the rheological properties of the host rock. A generalized derivation procedure for any viscoelastic model is presented accounting for the sequential excavation of a circular tunnel supported by any number of liners of different thicknesses and stiffnesses installed at different times in a viscoelastic surrounding rock under a hydrostatic stress field under plane strain axisymmetric conditions. Sequential excavation was accounted for assuming the radius of the tunnel growing from an initial value to a final one according to a time-dependent function to be prescribed by the designer. The effect of tunnel advancement was also considered. For the generalized Kelvin viscoelastic model, explicit analytical closed form solutions were presented, which can be reduced to the solutions for the Maxwell and Kelvin models.An extensive parametric analysis was then performed to investigate the effect of the excavation process adopted, the rheological properties of the rock, stiffness, thickness and installation times of the liners on tunnel convergence, pressure on the liners and on the stress field in the rock for a support system made of three liners. Several dimensionless charts for ease of use of practitioners were provided. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wong2008,
	abstract = {This paper is interested in the hydro-mechanical behaviour of an underground cavity abandoned at the end of its service life. It is an extension of a previous study that accounted for a poro-elastic behaviour of the rock mass (Int. J. Comput. Geomech. 2007; DOI: 10.1016/ j.compgeo.2007.11.003). Deterioration of the lining support with time leads to the transfer of the loading from the exterior massif to the interior backfill. The in situ material has a poro-visco-elastic constitutive behaviour while the backfill is poroelastic, both saturated with water. This loading transfer is accompanied by an inward cavity convergence, thereby compressing the backfill, and induces an outward water flow. This leads to a complex space-time evolution of pore pressures, displacements and stresses, which is not always intuitive. In its general setting, a semi-explicit solution to this problem is developed, using Laplace transform, the inversion being performed numerically. Analytical inversion leading to a quasi-explicit solution in the time domain is possible by identifying the characteristic creep and relaxation times of volumetric strains with those of the deviatoric strains, on the basis of a parametric study. A few numerical examples are given to illustrate the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the cavity and highlight the influence of key parameters (e.g. stiffness of backfill, lining deterioration rate, etc.). Further studies accounting for more general material behaviours for the backfill and external ground are ongoing. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

By using 3D nonlinear finite element method, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation process is dynamically simulated to analyze the stress and strain field status of surrounding rock and segment. The maximum tensile stress of segment ring caused by tunnel construction mainly lies in arch bottom and presents zonal distribution. The stress increases slightly and limitedly in the course of excavation. The maximum and minimum displacements of segment, manifesting as zonal distribution, distribute in arch bottom and vault respectively. The displacements slightly increase with the advance of TBM and gradually tend to stability. Precast concrete segment linings are the main load-bearing structure in tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnel , whose mechanical performance has a direct impact on tunnel safety. The correct mechanical analysis of segment linings is important to the design of TBM tunnel. At present, stability analysis of segment lining used in water conveyance delivery tunnel with TBM excavation has no unified calculation model and analysis method. Compared with TBM, shield method has been applied widely in the construction of urban subways and other traffic facilities.

@article{Zhong2016,
	abstract = {：In most studies of tunnel boring machine(TBM)tunnelling, the groundwater pressure was not considered , or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure. Meanwhile, the leakage, which mainly occurs in the segment joints, was often ignored in the relevant studies of TBM tunnelling. Additionally, the geological models in these studies were simplified to different extents, and mostly were simplified as homogenous bodies. Considering the deficiencies above, a 3D refined model of the surrounding rock of a tunnel is firstly established using NURBS-TIN-BReP hybrid data structure in this paper. Then the seepage field of the surrounding rock considering the leakage in the segment joints is simulated. Finally, the stability of TBM water diversion tunnel is studied coupled with the seepage simulation, to analyze the stress-strain conditions, the axial force and the bending moment of tunnel segment considering the leakage in the segment joints. The results illustrate that the maximum radial displacement, the minimum principal stress, the maximum principal stress and the axial force of segment lining considering the seepage effect are all larger than those disregarding the seepage effect. Keywords：segment lining; seepage-stress coupling; 3D geological model; TBM water diversion tunnel Today, almost all rock mass conditions can be bored by modern tunnel boring machines(TBMs)with the tunnel diameter varying from less than 3 m to more than 15 m. The TBMs are among the most technically sophisticated excavation machines in tunnelling industry [1]. The wide application leads to the deep research on the TBM construction technology, and many achievements have been made in construction simulation, structural stability analysis and groundwater pressure calculation. However, in many relevant studies the groundwater pressure was not considered, or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure [2-4] , which is inconsistent with engineering practices and unsafe [5]. The simulation results are more reasonable if the groundwater pressure is exerted as body force, and the seepage-stress coupling calculation can achieve more reliable expression for tunnel stability. The applications of seepage-stress coupling analysis in tunnel engineering are increasingly wide spread [6-10] , and many achievements have been made. However, most researches were concentrated on solving the settlement and deformation problem. Only a few studies took the groundwater pressure as body force by coupling the seepage field in the stability analysis model to study the groundwater effect. Meanwhile, the tunnel linings in the above studies were treated as impervious materials or homogeneous porous materials due to the limitation of simulation method. Wongsaroj et al [11] found there were great differences between the measured pore pressure and numerical simulation results when the shield tunnel lining was treated as uniform permeability. Shin [12] pointed out that the leakage of shield tunnel occurs mainly in partial locations such as segment joints and bolt holes. Therefore, the numerical simulation results will reflect engineering practices better if the leakage of shield tunnel is considered to occur in partial locations. But the relative studies are still rare at present, and},

This paper compiles a database consisting of 16 tunnel excavation projects in clayey soils using the earth pressure balance (EPB) tunneling method. Statistical analysis of the data is performed and the probability distributions for ground loss ratio $\eta$ and fitting parameter n, which are two major parameters in Peck's formula for transverse surface settlement, are identified based on 78 and 29 points of field data, respectively. The correlation between $\eta$ and n is fitted based on the data and its influences on the failure probability is evaluated. A serviceability performance function is modeled based on Peck's settlement formula, and the serviceability failure probability is defined and analyzed with Monte Carlo simulations. A series of design charts, in terms of tunnel diameter, cover/diameter ratio, $\eta$, and n, are generated for practical uses without running Monte Carlo simulations.},

@article{Zhu2013,
	abstract = {Vertical stresses in the earth's upper crust may be evaluated by the depth times the average unit weight of the overlying rock mass; however, the horizontal stress is difficult to obtain. Rock usually contains joints or cracks, and its fracture toughness is limited. If the horizontal stress acting on a cracked rock body exceeds a certain range, the crack will propagate and lead to rock fracture; and if a cracked rock is stable, the horizontal stress must be within a certain range. Therefore, from the stability condition of cracks, the range of horizontal stress can be evaluated. In this paper, a collinear crack model is employed to establish the cracked rock stability condition, and our theoretical results generally agreewith the in-situmeasurement results. The theoretical results can well explain the phenomenon that the ratio of horizontal stress to vertical stress near crust surface is scattered in a wide range, but in deep zone, it is scattered in a narrow range. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
