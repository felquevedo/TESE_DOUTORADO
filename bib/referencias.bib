	abstract = {{This paper describes "nite element procedures that have been developed to model the ground movements that occur when a shallow tunnel is installed in a clay soil. This study is part of a wider project concerned with the development of new methods to predict the likely extent of damage to surface structures caused by nearby shallow tunnelling. This particular paper, however, is concerned only with the numerical model of tunnel installation. The structural liner is an important component of this tunnel installation model; two di!erent ways of modelling the liner (based on continuum elements and shell elements) are discussed in the paper. A test problem consisting of the installation of a lined tunnel in an elastic continuum is used to investigate the merits of these di!erent approaches. When continuum elements are used to model the liner, the numerical results agree well with an analytical solution to the problem. When shell elements are used to model the liner, however, the results were found to be signi"cantly in#uenced by the particular formulation adopted for the shell elements. Example analyses, involving incremental tunnel construction in a clay soil where the soil is modelled using a kinematic hardening plasticity model, are described. These analyses con"rm that a thin layer of continuum elements may be used, satisfactorily, to model tunnel linings in a soil}structure interaction analysis of this sort},

@article{Barla2010,
	abstract = {This paper deals with full face excavation of large size tunnels in rock masses of very poor quality which exhibit squeezing behaviour. Time dependence is accounted for explicitly by using constitutive models which have been validated with reference to laboratory testing and in situ performance monitoring. The case study of the Saint Martin La Porte access adit (Lyon-Turin Base Tunnel) is taken as illustration. In this adit an innovative excavation-construction method is being used to cope with the severely squeezing Carboniferous zone encountered. An essential feature of this method is a two-stage excavation sequence with installation of a composite pre-reinforcement/reinforcement system with deformable elements embedded in the shotcrete lining. The tunnel response has been analysed by both semi-analytical and numerical solutions with close attention paid to the constitutive models adopted. Results of modelling are compared with convergence monitoring data.},

@article{Bernaud2009,
	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation by homogenization approach of the behaviour of a tunnel reinforced by fully grouted bolts, regarded as periodically distributed linear inclusions. Owing to the fact that a direct numerical simulation would require the ground and the reinforcing bolts be separately discretized, leading thus to a highly complex and oversized problem, a homogenization procedure is developed, aimed at circumventing the difficulties connected with the implementation of a direct simulation. The situations of reinforcement by radial bolts and horizontal anchors installed ahead the excavation face are both investigated. Considering a Drucker-Prager rock material, elastoplastic constitutive equations are formulated for the bolted rock mass regarded as a homogenized anisotropic medium at the macroscopic scale. Special attention is paid to the description of the algorithm of plastic integration involved in the finite element implementation. At this respect, closed-form expressions are derived for the stress projection onto the macroscopic yield surface. The finite element procedure is thus carried out for simulating the advancement of a bolt-supported tunnel and computing the displacements of the tunnel walls and the facing as the excavation proceeds. A parametric study, varying some relevant parameters defining the bolt reinforcement scheme, is undertaken by means of the finite element tool. The combination of rock bolting with a classical lining support system such as a shotcrete layer is also examined, thus providing some guidelines for the optimal design of the reinforcement pattern. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Burd2000,
	abstract = {Current practice for assessment of settlement damage to buildings due to tunnel construction usually starts with a procedure in which greenfield settlements are imposed on a structual model of the building. This process ignores the important interaction effects that the weight and stiffness of the building have on the settlements. This paper describes a threedimensional finite element analysis in which the tunnel, the soil and a building are all treated in a single analysis. Example calculations are described, and these indicate that interaction between the building and the ground can have a significant effect on the extent of the predicted damage. The performance of the building is seen to be highly dependent on whether the settlements induce a sagging or hogging mode of deformation. The analyses are used to plot contours of soil surface settlement and also expected crack patterns within the building.},

@article{Chakeri2011,
	abstract = {Tunnels are increasingly being excavated in soft ground conditions when services are required in urban environments, and it is now common to have tunnels crossing at various elevations. As the tunnel excavations are undertaken at different levels, there will be an interaction which can have a significant influence on stress distribu- tions and consequently deformations within the tunnels and surface settlement. As multi-layer tunnelling is a three dimensional phenomenon in nature, 3D numerical solutions must be utilized for perpendicularly crossing tunnels at various levels. This paper reports the investigations into the changes in stress distribution, deformations and surface settlements which may be expected when the twin Tohid Tunnels pass beneath the Line 4 metro tunnel in Tehran.},

@incollection{Chan2008,
	abstract = {A numerical method for the calculation of the overall behaviour of a non-trivial three-dimensional saturated soil-structure system is presented in this paper. The numerical modelling of saturated soil is discussed in detail together with comparisons with soil-structure physical experiments performed on the centrifuge facilities at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the VELACS project.
	In order to model the saturated soil, three main components are needed for the numerical simulation and they are as follows:
	
	The establishment of an adequate mathematical framework to describe the phenomenon
	The establishment of a numerical (discrete) approximation procedure
	The establishment of an adequate constitutive relationship for the material behaviour
	The numerical procedure employs the Biot formulation as the basic mathematical framework, the Finite Element method for spatial discretisation and the Generalised Newmark scheme for time stepping [1]. The u-p formulation is used with displacement (u) and pore pressure (p) as the primary unknowns and the constitutive relationship used is the Pastor-Zienkiewicz mark III model [2].
	
	The numerical procedure is validated using Test No.12 from the VELACS [3] experiments, is a dynamic three-dimensional soil-structure interaction test with a model of a structure in the form of a block being placed on a saturated sand layer overlaid by a thin silt layer and subjected to earthquake-like base motion. The tests were performed at 100g centrifugal acceleration at Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of California, Davis [4].
	
	Very good comparisons with the results from the physical centrifuges test had been obtained. All the accelerations predicted were in good agreement with the measured values. Very good comparisons were also obtained for most of the pore water pressure transducers though in some locations, the level of excess pore pressure rise was slightly lower than that measured. Around 10cm settlement was predicted by the numerical analysis which is between the value obtained at UC Davis (9cm) and RPI (13cm). But a very wide spread of the measured vertical settlement was observed therefore the measured final settlement value may not be too trustworthy for comparison purposes however the numerical prediction correctly modelled the trend at which the settlement developed.
	
	These results confirmed that the assumptions and the approximation used in the numerical procedure are sound and further analyses on various three-dimensional examples and further investigations on the use of iterative solvers instead of the direct solver used in this study are underway.},

@article{Do2014,
	abstract = {The increase in transportation in large cities makes it necessary to construct of twin tunnels at shallow depths. Thus, the prediction of the influence of a new tunnel construction on an already existing one plays a key role in the optimal design and construction of close parallel shield tunnels in order to avoid any damage to the existing tunnel during and after excavation of the new tunnel.Most of the reported cases in the literature on parallel mechanized excavation of twin tunnels have focused on the effects of the ground condition, tunnel size, tunnel depth, surface loads, and relative position between the two tunnels on tunnel behaviour. The numerical investigation performed in this study, using the FLAC3D finite difference element programme, has made it possible to include the influence of the construction process between the two tunnels. The structural forces induced in both tunnels and the development of the displacement field in the surrounding ground have been highlighted.The results of the numerical analysis have indicated a great impact of a new tunnel construction on an existing tunnel. The influence of the lagged distance between the two tunnels faces has also been highlighted. Generally, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels causes smaller structural forces and lining displacements than those induced in the case of twin tunnels excavated at a large lagged distance. However, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels could result in a higher settlement above the two tunnels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The analysis of shallow tunnels is necessarily related to the study of the excavation influence on the ground surface. As the excavation proceeds, surface settlements are expected to be generated, forming the so-called settlement basin. Thereby, its correct evaluation is important since these movements could create disturbances in surrounding structures. Estimation of tunneling-induced ground movements can be done by analytical, empirical, and numerical methods and, currently, the best assessment of tunneling process consists of finite element modeling. The current paper presents a numerical model elaborated in the software ANSYS with the aim to evaluate the surface settlements induced by tunneling. The 3D finite element model concerns soil and lining elements, using the activation and deactivation tool to simulate the excavation and lining placement. To perform the analysis, the soil mass was represented by a plastic model using the Drucker Prager criterion and the concrete lining is considered elastic. Five reported cases of real tunnels (Heathrow Express, Green Park, Barcelona Subway, Bras{\'{i}}lia Subway, and S{\~{a}}o Paulo Para{\'{i}}so tunnels) are simulated to validate the model with analytical and experimental solutions.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this review paper is to present the techniques, advances, problems and likely future developments in numerical modelling for rock mechanics. Such modelling is essential for studying the fundamental processes occurring in rocks and for rock engineering design. The review begins by explaining the special nature of rock masses and the consequential difficulties when attempting to model their inherent characteristics of discontinuousness, anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inelasticity. The rock engineering design backdrop to the review is also presented. The different types of numerical models are outlined in Section 2, together with a discussion on how to obtain the necessary parameters for the models. There is also discussion on the value that is obtained from the modelling, especially the enhanced understanding of those mechanisms initiated by engineering perturbations. In Section 3, the largest section, states-of-the-art and advances associated with the main methods are presented in detail. In many cases, for the model to adequately represent the rock reality, it is necessary to incorporate couplings between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. The physical processes and the equations characterizing the coupled behaviour are included in Section 4, with an illustrative example and discussion on the likely future development of coupled models. Finally, in Section 5, the advances and outstanding issues in the subject are listed and in Section 6 there are specific recommendations concerning quality control, enhancing confidence in the models, and the potential future developments. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model takes into account three coupled processes: the decrease in permeability due to the squeezing of initially open cracks, the increase in permeability due to the growth of extensile cracks, and the increase in permeability due to the growth of shear cracks. Calibration studies with the model show close agreement with lab data.},

@article{Manchao2015,
	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing worldwide in mining and civil engineering. There have been several accidents that resulted in delays, cost overruns, some with more severe consequences. To help minimize these accidents, it is necessary to assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction and exploration. A particular type of accident, or undesirable event, which can occur during tunnel construction and operation, is associated with the occurrence of excessive deformations occurring inside the tunnel. This can happen due to deficient design, construction defects, and high in situ stresses or due to specific swelling and squeezing grounds. Deep coal mines where large deformations can occur during and after excavations due to the soft properties of the rock and the high in situ stresses, are particularly vulnerable to this type of event. The associated non-linear problems are related with geomechanical behavior of the rock mass, changes in the geometry of cavities and in some cases with developing surface contacts due to large strains. In this paper, the phenomena involved in large material deformations are analyzed in detail and the basic equations for the Chen's large deformation theory are presented. The application of an FEM based method to simulate large material deformations, the Material Point Method (MPM) to the simulation of large deformation that occurs in tunnels when failure occurs, is also described. An application of MPM to the Jiahe Coal Mine, in China is presented, and the numerical results obtained with MPM compared with solutions using Chen's large deformation theory. Safety considerations about the excessive deformation scenario in tunnels are drawn and a risk assessment methodology with special use of Bayesian networks is proposed. A simplified schematic example was presented for two case scenarios.},

This is particularly true for tunnels excavated in soft rock which could sustain large deformations. In this context, the forecast and the assessment of the behaviour of the rock mass during the tunnel's construction stages, as well as in the long term, require numerical modelling with the use of appropriate constitutive models. In this paper, current models which are based on the viscoplasticity coupled to the damage theory are presented. They enable the computing of creep strains, stress relaxation and possibly, time at failure, if the damage process of the rock is taken into account. Thereafter a numerical modelling of an underground gallery is presented based on this model. The role of the main construction characteristics, such as the rate of excavation and the delay for support installations, is finally discussed.},

The nomograms make it possible to assess the feasibility of a TBM drive in a given geotechnical situation and to evaluate potential design measures or operational measures such as reductions in shield length, the installation of a higher thrust force, increases in the overcut or the lubrication of the shield surface, thus making a valuable contribution to the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of one or two decimetres may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support).

This study emphasizes some important factors that influence the tunnel calculation, such as tunnel face, history of excavation phases, timing of the lining mounting, lining stiffness, and depth of the tunnel. The analytical approach is based on the determination and integration of the rock-lining interface differential equation.

In addition it becomes increasingly common to use results from numerical analysis as basis for designing the support measures for the tunnel. When doing so, the strongly nonlinear material behaviour of shotcrete, namely the increase of stiffness and strength with time, should be taken into account, in particular when the excavated cross section is subdivided in several construction stages involving temporary shotcrete structures with high stress concentrations near corners. In this paper a new constitutive model for shotcrete is applied in the numerical analysis of a complex underground railway station. It could be shown that significant differences in lining stresses are obtained when employing the newly developed constitutive model for shotcrete.

By using 3D nonlinear finite element method, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation process is dynamically simulated to analyze the stress and strain field status of surrounding rock and segment. The maximum tensile stress of segment ring caused by tunnel construction mainly lies in arch bottom and presents zonal distribution. The stress increases slightly and limitedly in the course of excavation. The maximum and minimum displacements of segment, manifesting as zonal distribution, distribute in arch bottom and vault respectively. The displacements slightly increase with the advance of TBM and gradually tend to stability. Precast concrete segment linings are the main load-bearing structure in tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnel , whose mechanical performance has a direct impact on tunnel safety. The correct mechanical analysis of segment linings is important to the design of TBM tunnel. At present, stability analysis of segment lining used in water conveyance delivery tunnel with TBM excavation has no unified calculation model and analysis method. Compared with TBM, shield method has been applied widely in the construction of urban subways and other traffic facilities. Structural stability of tunnel excavation with shield method has been developed at home and abroad [1-15]. Aiming at the deep tunnel construction with TBM, using 3D nonlinear finite element method, this paper establishes a 3D finite element simulation model to dynamically simulate TBM digging process and analyze the stability of wall rock and segment.},

@article{Zhong2016,
	abstract = {：In most studies of tunnel boring machine(TBM)tunnelling, the groundwater pressure was not considered , or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure. Meanwhile, the leakage, which mainly occurs in the segment joints, was often ignored in the relevant studies of TBM tunnelling. Additionally, the geological models in these studies were simplified to different extents, and mostly were simplified as homogenous bodies. Considering the deficiencies above, a 3D refined model of the surrounding rock of a tunnel is firstly established using NURBS-TIN-BReP hybrid data structure in this paper. Then the seepage field of the surrounding rock considering the leakage in the segment joints is simulated. Finally, the stability of TBM water diversion tunnel is studied coupled with the seepage simulation, to analyze the stress-strain conditions, the axial force and the bending moment of tunnel segment considering the leakage in the segment joints. The results illustrate that the maximum radial displacement, the minimum principal stress, the maximum principal stress and the axial force of segment lining considering the seepage effect are all larger than those disregarding the seepage effect. Keywords：segment lining; seepage-stress coupling; 3D geological model; TBM water diversion tunnel Today, almost all rock mass conditions can be bored by modern tunnel boring machines(TBMs)with the tunnel diameter varying from less than 3 m to more than 15 m. The TBMs are among the most technically sophisticated excavation machines in tunnelling industry [1]. The wide application leads to the deep research on the TBM construction technology, and many achievements have been made in construction simulation, structural stability analysis and groundwater pressure calculation. However, in many relevant studies the groundwater pressure was not considered, or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure [2-4] , which is inconsistent with engineering practices and unsafe [5]. The simulation results are more reasonable if the groundwater pressure is exerted as body force, and the seepage-stress coupling calculation can achieve more reliable expression for tunnel stability. The applications of seepage-stress coupling analysis in tunnel engineering are increasingly wide spread [6-10] , and many achievements have been made. However, most researches were concentrated on solving the settlement and deformation problem. Only a few studies took the groundwater pressure as body force by coupling the seepage field in the stability analysis model to study the groundwater effect. Meanwhile, the tunnel linings in the above studies were treated as impervious materials or homogeneous porous materials due to the limitation of simulation method. Wongsaroj et al [11] found there were great differences between the measured pore pressure and numerical simulation results when the shield tunnel lining was treated as uniform permeability. Shin [12] pointed out that the leakage of shield tunnel occurs mainly in partial locations such as segment joints and bolt holes. Therefore, the numerical simulation results will reflect engineering practices better if the leakage of shield tunnel is considered to occur in partial locations. But the relative studies are still rare at present, and},
