	abstract = {Rock mass behaviour model selection and, in particular, rock mass post-failure behaviour are key issues in analysing tunnel stability, in particular in terms of the correct application of design techniques such as the convergence-confinement method and also numerical modelling. Three different quality rock masses (good, average and poor) were defined in which simulated standard tunnels were excavated. Different behaviours - including elastic perfectly plastic, elastic brittle and three strain softening behaviours - were modelled for each type of rock mass and increasingly realistic parameters were calculated, along with the corresponding ground reaction curves. The results obtained demonstrate the importance of adequate post-failure behaviour model selection for tunnel analysis. Also assessed are the effects of the standard support and reinforcement. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Armand2013,
	abstract = {Since 2000, the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (ANDRA) has been constructing an Underground Research Laboratory (URL) at Bure (east of the Paris Basin) to perform experiments in order to obtain in situ data necessary to demonstrate the feasibility of geological repository in the Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. An important experimental program is planned to characterize the response of the rock to different drift construction methods. Before 2008, at the main level of the laboratory, most of the drifts were excavated using pneumatic hammer and supported with rock bolts, sliding steel arches and fiber shotcrete. Other techniques, such as road header techniques, stiff and flexible supports, have also been used to characterize their impacts. The drift network is developed following the in situ major stresses. The parallel drifts are separated enough so as they can be considered independently when their hydromechanical (HM) behaviors are compared. Mine-by experiments have been performed to measure the HM response of the rock and the mechanical loading applied to the support system due to the digging and after excavation. Drifts exhibit extensional (mode I) and shear fractures (modes II and III) induced by excavation works. The extent of the induced fracture networks depends on the drift orientation versus the in situ stress field. This paper describes the drift convergence and deformation in the surrounding rock walls as function of time and the impact of different support methods on the rock mass behavior. An observation based method is finally applied to distinguish the instantaneous and time-dependent parts of the rock mass deformation around the drifts. {\textcopyright} 2013 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {{This paper describes "nite element procedures that have been developed to model the ground movements that occur when a shallow tunnel is installed in a clay soil. This study is part of a wider project concerned with the development of new methods to predict the likely extent of damage to surface structures caused by nearby shallow tunnelling. This particular paper, however, is concerned only with the numerical model of tunnel installation. The structural liner is an important component of this tunnel installation model; two di!erent ways of modelling the liner (based on continuum elements and shell elements) are discussed in the paper. A test problem consisting of the installation of a lined tunnel in an elastic continuum is used to investigate the merits of these di!erent approaches. When continuum elements are used to model the liner, the numerical results agree well with an analytical solution to the problem. When shell elements are used to model the liner, however, the results were found to be signi"cantly in#uenced by the particular formulation adopted for the shell elements. Example analyses, involving incremental tunnel construction in a clay soil where the soil is modelled using a kinematic hardening plasticity model, are described. These analyses con"rm that a thin layer of continuum elements may be used, satisfactorily, to model tunnel linings in a soil}structure interaction analysis of this sort},

	abstract = {This paper deals with full face excavation of large size tunnels in rock masses of very poor quality which exhibit squeezing behaviour. Time dependence is accounted for explicitly by using constitutive models which have been validated with reference to laboratory testing and in situ performance monitoring. The case study of the Saint Martin La Porte access adit (Lyon-Turin Base Tunnel) is taken as illustration. In this adit an innovative excavation-construction method is being used to cope with the severely squeezing Carboniferous zone encountered. An essential feature of this method is a two-stage excavation sequence with installation of a composite pre-reinforcement/reinforcement system with deformable elements embedded in the shotcrete lining. The tunnel response has been analysed by both semi-analytical and numerical solutions with close attention paid to the constitutive models adopted. Results of modelling are compared with convergence monitoring data.},

@article{Bernaud2009,
	abstract = {This paper is devoted to the theoretical modeling and numerical simulation by homogenization approach of the behaviour of a tunnel reinforced by fully grouted bolts, regarded as periodically distributed linear inclusions. Owing to the fact that a direct numerical simulation would require the ground and the reinforcing bolts be separately discretized, leading thus to a highly complex and oversized problem, a homogenization procedure is developed, aimed at circumventing the difficulties connected with the implementation of a direct simulation. The situations of reinforcement by radial bolts and horizontal anchors installed ahead the excavation face are both investigated. Considering a Drucker-Prager rock material, elastoplastic constitutive equations are formulated for the bolted rock mass regarded as a homogenized anisotropic medium at the macroscopic scale. Special attention is paid to the description of the algorithm of plastic integration involved in the finite element implementation. At this respect, closed-form expressions are derived for the stress projection onto the macroscopic yield surface. The finite element procedure is thus carried out for simulating the advancement of a bolt-supported tunnel and computing the displacements of the tunnel walls and the facing as the excavation proceeds. A parametric study, varying some relevant parameters defining the bolt reinforcement scheme, is undertaken by means of the finite element tool. The combination of rock bolting with a classical lining support system such as a shotcrete layer is also examined, thus providing some guidelines for the optimal design of the reinforcement pattern. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {This paper presents a back analysis of the time-dependent behaviour of a monitored tunnel in Switzerland. It concerns a specific section of the Mont Terri reconnaissance gallery which was excavated in creeping rock. From a theoretical point of view, Lemaitre's viscoplastic model was implemented in the FLAC 2D finite-difference numerical code. Particular attention was paid to the stability of the numerical solution for such an explicit mode of resolution. Lemaitre model parameters were successfully fitted on creep tests and then on in situ convergence measurements after a complete numerical simulation. Based on the comparison of strain and stress measured in the lining with the calculated values, time-dependent behaviour can finally be extrapolated over a period of approximately 10 years. Scale effects between results of in situ and laboratory fittings are also discussed. The aim of these investigations is to justify the interest of Lemaitre's model for the analysis of time-dependent behaviour of underground structures over a long period of time. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This process ignores the important interaction effects that the weight and stiffness of the building have on the settlements. This paper describes a threedimensional finite element analysis in which the tunnel, the soil and a building are all treated in a single analysis. Example calculations are described, and these indicate that interaction between the building and the ground can have a significant effect on the extent of the predicted damage. The performance of the building is seen to be highly dependent on whether the settlements induce a sagging or hogging mode of deformation. The analyses are used to plot contours of soil surface settlement and also expected crack patterns within the building.},

@article{Carranza-Torres1999,
	abstract = {This paper is intended to illustrate the relationship between the Hoek-Brown parameters describing the strength of rock masses and the mechanical response of underground openings. A formulation of the elasto-plastic behavior of rock in terms of the Hoek-Brown criterion is presented. The analysis assumes that the joint system present in the rock mass has no preferred orientation so that the medium can be considered to behave as an isotropic continuum. It is shown that appropriate scaling of the Hoek-Brown parameters leads to considerable simplification in defining the elasto-plastic response of the rock mass. The classical case in which the excavation process is treated as a uniform reduction of internal pressure in symmetrically loaded cylindrical and spherical cavities is considered. Closed-form expressions are given for the extent of plastic behavior and the related stress and displacement fields. A dimensionless graphical representation of these solutions is provided that allows accurate estimates of the response of excavations in Hoek-Brown materials to be made quickly and easily. Examples are given to illustrate the use of the graphs. Illustrative applications of the derived closed-form solutions are also described. The construction of ground reaction curves for the design of cylindrical tunnels according to the convergence-confinement method and a case study of stability analysis of spherical cavities produced by underground nuclear explosions in French Polynesian atolls are discussed.},

	abstract = {The Hoek-Brown failure criterion is a semi-empirical method widely used in the estimation of shear strength of rock. Among other parameters involved in this criterion, the coefficient a dictates whether the criterion applies to intact rock or rock masses (a = 0.5 for intact rock and a > 0.5 for rock masses). Most of the existing elasto-plastic solutions for tunnel problems in Hoek-Brown media consider an intact rock (i.e., a = 0.5). This is not only due to historical reasons (the failure criterion was originally developed for intact rock), but also due to the mathematical difficulties of deriving neat, closed-form expressions for the general case in which a ≥ 0.5. This paper presents a rigorous, elasto-plastic solution for the axi-symmetrical problem of excavating a circular tunnel in generalized Hoek-Brown material (a ≥ 0.5). The solution is obtained by re-writing the generalized Hoek-Brown failure criterion in terms of transformed stress quantities. Application of the transformation rule described in this paper to elasto-plastic problems of excavations in generalized Hoek-Brown materials is shown to bring significant advantages in the interpretation and extrapolation of results obtained with analytical and numerical methods.},

@incollection{Chan2008,
	abstract = {A numerical method for the calculation of the overall behaviour of a non-trivial three-dimensional saturated soil-structure system is presented in this paper. The numerical modelling of saturated soil is discussed in detail together with comparisons with soil-structure physical experiments performed on the centrifuge facilities at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the VELACS project.
	In order to model the saturated soil, three main components are needed for the numerical simulation and they are as follows:
	
	The establishment of an adequate mathematical framework to describe the phenomenon
	The establishment of a numerical (discrete) approximation procedure
	The establishment of an adequate constitutive relationship for the material behaviour
	The numerical procedure employs the Biot formulation as the basic mathematical framework, the Finite Element method for spatial discretisation and the Generalised Newmark scheme for time stepping [1]. The u-p formulation is used with displacement (u) and pore pressure (p) as the primary unknowns and the constitutive relationship used is the Pastor-Zienkiewicz mark III model [2].
	
	The numerical procedure is validated using Test No.12 from the VELACS [3] experiments, is a dynamic three-dimensional soil-structure interaction test with a model of a structure in the form of a block being placed on a saturated sand layer overlaid by a thin silt layer and subjected to earthquake-like base motion. The tests were performed at 100g centrifugal acceleration at Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of California, Davis [4].
	
	Very good comparisons with the results from the physical centrifuges test had been obtained. All the accelerations predicted were in good agreement with the measured values. Very good comparisons were also obtained for most of the pore water pressure transducers though in some locations, the level of excess pore pressure rise was slightly lower than that measured. Around 10cm settlement was predicted by the numerical analysis which is between the value obtained at UC Davis (9cm) and RPI (13cm). But a very wide spread of the measured vertical settlement was observed therefore the measured final settlement value may not be too trustworthy for comparison purposes however the numerical prediction correctly modelled the trend at which the settlement developed.
	
	These results confirmed that the assumptions and the approximation used in the numerical procedure are sound and further analyses on various three-dimensional examples and further investigations on the use of iterative solvers instead of the direct solver used in this study are underway.},

The case of circular tunnels is considered and the formulation of the mathematical problem is discussed. Furthermore, the creep of rock around a tunnel with nonlinear supports (called "yieldable" or "self-adapting" supports) to limit the closure of the tunnel is studied. It is shown that the ultimate ground reaction is not unique since it depends on the loading history such as excavation layout and support design. For relatively small pressures exerted by the support, it is shown that the onset of failure by dilatancy can be determined. Two kinds of solutions are given: a simplified approximate one, which is easy to apply and with which the qualitative discussion of the solution is simple and revealing, and a more rigorous general elaborate numerical solution obtained by using computer programs. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

An analytical approach to the viscoplastic behaviour of a rock mass around a deep tunnel in different stages of a simplified life cycle is presented. The viscoplasticity is modelled by means of a simple (linear) Norton-Hoff's law. First, the solution for a dry rock mass is presented, then an extension to a particular case of a porous saturated rock mass with a Poisson's ratio of 0.5 is examined. Some numerical examples are carried out to show the consistency and relevance of the solutions. Parametric studies illustrate the influence of key parameters such as rock mass viscosity and time of lining emplacement. This analytical approach constitutes a useful reference to test more complex numerical simulation and makes it possible to obtain practical estimations of the poromechanical behaviour of underground structures.},

@article{Detournay1987,
	abstract = {This paper describes a two-dimensional elastoplastic model of a long, cylindrical cavity in an infinite rock mass subject to non-hydrostatic far-field stress loading. The rock is assumed to behave as an elastoplastic dilatant material that is characterized by a cohesive frictional yield strength. The analysis is based on a solution of the elastoplastic interface that is applicable when the underground cavity becomes completely surrounded by a zone of failed rock, and for stress conditions for which the problem is statically determined. This latter restriction limits the range of deviation from a hydrostatic stress condition that can be analyzed with the model. The stress and displacement field induced by excavation unloading of the cavity is determined on the basis of a proportional load trajectory that involves a monotonic decrease of internal pressure in the cavity. For this particular load history, the elastoplastic boundary grows in a self-similar manner. This allows both displacement and stress field to be calculated in a unit plane, defined by dividing all physical lengths by the characteristic size of the plastic zone. This feature of the solution eliminates the need to solve continuously for the stress and displacement during the evolution of the plastic region. Explicit formulation of the stress field in the plane and of the displacement field in the elastic region is provided; determination of the displacement field in the elastic region is obtained numerically using the method of characteristics. Some important specific results are discussed; a single parameter, the "obliquity" (m), defined as the ratio between the stress deviator at infinity and the yield limit, is found to control the shape of the failed rock region and the uneven closure of the cavity. It is found also that the direction of maximum closure may become perpendicular to the maximum far-field compressive stress under some loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

The latter is a significant growth industry, particularly in Europe where subalpine base tunnels in excess of 10 m wide and dozens of kilometres long are being driven by tunnel boring machine (TBM) through alpine terrain at depths greater than 2 km. In more massive granitoid or gneissic ground, these tunnels have experienced significant spalling damage. En route to a practical predictive technique for this condition, the author utilizes a number of analytical and micromechanical tools to validate a simple empirical predictive model for tunnel spall initiation. The true nature of damage and of yield, as the result of extensile damage accumulation, in hard rocks is examined using these tools. Based on the resultant conceptual model, the author expands on the empirical damage threshold, using a spalling limit to differentiate stress paths that lead to crack propagation and spalling from those that incur stable microdamage prior to conventional shear failure at higher relative confinements. Finally, the composite and robust in situ yield model is applied to nonlinear modelling for support design.},

	abstract = {The increase in transportation in large cities makes it necessary to construct of twin tunnels at shallow depths. Thus, the prediction of the influence of a new tunnel construction on an already existing one plays a key role in the optimal design and construction of close parallel shield tunnels in order to avoid any damage to the existing tunnel during and after excavation of the new tunnel.Most of the reported cases in the literature on parallel mechanized excavation of twin tunnels have focused on the effects of the ground condition, tunnel size, tunnel depth, surface loads, and relative position between the two tunnels on tunnel behaviour. The numerical investigation performed in this study, using the FLAC3D finite difference element programme, has made it possible to include the influence of the construction process between the two tunnels. The structural forces induced in both tunnels and the development of the displacement field in the surrounding ground have been highlighted.The results of the numerical analysis have indicated a great impact of a new tunnel construction on an existing tunnel. The influence of the lagged distance between the two tunnels faces has also been highlighted. Generally, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels causes smaller structural forces and lining displacements than those induced in the case of twin tunnels excavated at a large lagged distance. However, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels could result in a higher settlement above the two tunnels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This variation depends on the advance of the tunnel and on the rheological behavior of the hosting rock mass. In this paper, the effect of creep, in the response of the tunnel is discussed. The objective of the paper is to predict time-dependent displacement of the tunnel wall, after stopping the excavation or after installing the support system. The rock mass is assumed to be isotropic and homogenous and incompressible. The tunnel is assumed to be circular and driven in a hydrostatic stress field. The rate of excavation is considered to be infinitely large. The Burger's body which is able to model the primary and secondary creep regions of the rock mass is applied. In such a condition, an analytical solution for predicting time-dependent deformation of tunnel wall is derived. Thereafter, the application of the proposed solution is illustrated through three examples. The examples are analyzed numerically using the finite difference code FLAC. The results obtained from numerical analyses show proper agreement to the results of proposed solution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

As the excavation proceeds, surface settlements are expected to be generated, forming the so-called settlement basin. Thereby, its correct evaluation is important since these movements could create disturbances in surrounding structures. Estimation of tunneling-induced ground movements can be done by analytical, empirical, and numerical methods and, currently, the best assessment of tunneling process consists of finite element modeling. The current paper presents a numerical model elaborated in the software ANSYS with the aim to evaluate the surface settlements induced by tunneling. The 3D finite element model concerns soil and lining elements, using the activation and deactivation tool to simulate the excavation and lining placement. To perform the analysis, the soil mass was represented by a plastic model using the Drucker Prager criterion and the concrete lining is considered elastic. Five reported cases of real tunnels (Heathrow Express, Green Park, Barcelona Subway, Bras{\'{i}}lia Subway, and S{\~{a}}o Paulo Para{\'{i}}so tunnels) are simulated to validate the model with analytical and experimental solutions.},

Some simple linear and nonlinear constitutive laws are presented able to describe this phenomenon and their use in the solution of boundary value problems by means of the finite element method is discussed. Finally, the results of some numerical analyses are presented that illustrate the effects taking place around tunnels driven into squeezing rocks.},

@article{Guayacan-Carrillo2016,
	abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to analyze the convergence measurements in drifts of the Underground Research Laboratory (URL) of the French National Radioactive Waste Management Agency (Andra), excavated in Callovo-Oxfordian claystone. These measurements show an anisotropic closure, which depends on the drift orientations with respect to the horizontal in situ stresses. This anisotropic character of the deformation is taken into account by assuming that the drifts section evolves following an elliptical shape. The characteristics of the deformed elliptical section are evaluated following the methodology proposed by Vu et al. (Rock Mech Rock Eng 46:231–246, 2013). Then, using the semi-empirical law proposed by Sulem et al. (Int J Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abstr 24:145–154, 1987), the convergence evolution is fitted independently for each axis of the ellipse. This method allows to distinguish two effects: the face advance and the time-dependent behavior of the ground. The results for the two drift orientations (along the major horizontal stress and perpendicular to it) show very close values for the parameters describing the time-dependent properties of the ground, the distance of influence of the face, and the extent of the decompressed zone around the drift. Finally, the model is validated by keeping these parameters as constants and by simulating the convergence data on a new drift. It is shown that with a period of about 40 days of convergence monitoring, the model can provide valuable insights for predictions of the convergence evolution in the long term.},

@article{Jing2003,
	abstract = {The purpose of this review paper is to present the techniques, advances, problems and likely future developments in numerical modelling for rock mechanics. Such modelling is essential for studying the fundamental processes occurring in rocks and for rock engineering design. The review begins by explaining the special nature of rock masses and the consequential difficulties when attempting to model their inherent characteristics of discontinuousness, anisotropy, inhomogeneity and inelasticity. The rock engineering design backdrop to the review is also presented. The different types of numerical models are outlined in Section 2, together with a discussion on how to obtain the necessary parameters for the models. There is also discussion on the value that is obtained from the modelling, especially the enhanced understanding of those mechanisms initiated by engineering perturbations. In Section 3, the largest section, states-of-the-art and advances associated with the main methods are presented in detail. In many cases, for the model to adequately represent the rock reality, it is necessary to incorporate couplings between the thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes. The physical processes and the equations characterizing the coupled behaviour are included in Section 4, with an illustrative example and discussion on the likely future development of coupled models. Finally, in Section 5, the advances and outstanding issues in the subject are listed and in Section 6 there are specific recommendations concerning quality control, enhancing confidence in the models, and the potential future developments. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Mesri1981,
	abstract = {Shear stress-strain-time models for soils were examined in terms of undrained triaxial compression tests, with pore water pressure measurement, using reconstituted specimens of kaolinite and Cucaracha shale. Multiple-step constant load and constant rate of deformation tests were performed. The testing variables included final equal all-round consolidation pressure (100-800 lb/in2), overconsolidation ratio (1-8) and the magnitude of the first load increment (20-82% in terms of shear stress level). Additional constant load test data reported in the literature were analysed. The parameters of an exponential stress-strain model were expressed and interpreted in terms of the parameters of the hyperbolic stress-strain model. The parameters of both models can be expressed in terms of the undrained modulus to undrained shear strength ratio Eu/su and the axial strain at failure $\epsilon$f. The creep parameter $\lambda$ which controls time or strain rate effects was correlated with Eu/su. It appears that any soil has a potential total strain at any shear stress level, and that $\lambda$ is directly related to the magnitude of the remaining strain. A large value of Eu/su means a small strain at any small time. Therefore as Eu/su increases, the remaining strain and thus $\lambda$ increase. Alternative combinations of the hyperbolic stress-strain and either power strain-time or power strain-strain rate relationships are suggested as possible creep models for the analysis of field problems and interpretation of laboratory tests. {\textcopyright} 1981, Thomas Telford Ltd.

@article{Manchao2015,
	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing worldwide in mining and civil engineering. There have been several accidents that resulted in delays, cost overruns, some with more severe consequences. To help minimize these accidents, it is necessary to assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction and exploration. A particular type of accident, or undesirable event, which can occur during tunnel construction and operation, is associated with the occurrence of excessive deformations occurring inside the tunnel. This can happen due to deficient design, construction defects, and high in situ stresses or due to specific swelling and squeezing grounds. Deep coal mines where large deformations can occur during and after excavations due to the soft properties of the rock and the high in situ stresses, are particularly vulnerable to this type of event. The associated non-linear problems are related with geomechanical behavior of the rock mass, changes in the geometry of cavities and in some cases with developing surface contacts due to large strains. In this paper, the phenomena involved in large material deformations are analyzed in detail and the basic equations for the Chen's large deformation theory are presented. The application of an FEM based method to simulate large material deformations, the Material Point Method (MPM) to the simulation of large deformation that occurs in tunnels when failure occurs, is also described. An application of MPM to the Jiahe Coal Mine, in China is presented, and the numerical results obtained with MPM compared with solutions using Chen's large deformation theory. Safety considerations about the excessive deformation scenario in tunnels are drawn and a risk assessment methodology with special use of Bayesian networks is proposed. A simplified schematic example was presented for two case scenarios.},

	abstract = {The material model consists of a viscoelastic Burgers element and an additional viscoplastic element, which includes Bingham viscosity and a viscoplastic Kelvin element. For spherical and cylindrical cavities, expressions are derived for the stress and strain fields and volume convergence. Spherical and cylindrical cavities are treated in a unified formulation. The expressions for the transient phase require a numerical approach. A simple numerical scheme is proposed which solves these expressions efficiently. For constant pressurization stationary stresses, strain rates and convergence rate will eventually arise. Exact, closed-form solutions are derived for these quantities. The magnitude of the Maxwell viscosity is of vital importance for the stationary state. The material model compares favourably with experimental creep data. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the mechanism of tunnel convergence is essential for designing the required support of a tunnel. To take various time effects on the convergence-confinement relation into account, it is possible to correlate different factors with time, then to deal with their collective effects. As a result, the time-dependent tunnel deformation problem can be modelled as a viscoelastic problem. The solutions of various viscoelastic models can be obtained from the corresponding elastic solution based on a standard procedure. In this paper, a hierarchical approach, which considers: (1) the rheological properties of a rock mass; (2) the advancement of the tunnel; and (3) the tunnel-support interaction is proposed to model the excavation/construction process during the tunnelling in a rock mass with rheological properties. The time-dependent factors considered in the proposed model are discussed. Subsequently, the theoretical formulation of this model is developed. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

This is particularly true for tunnels excavated in soft rock which could sustain large deformations. In this context, the forecast and the assessment of the behaviour of the rock mass during the tunnel's construction stages, as well as in the long term, require numerical modelling with the use of appropriate constitutive models. In this paper, current models which are based on the viscoplasticity coupled to the damage theory are presented. They enable the computing of creep strains, stress relaxation and possibly, time at failure, if the damage process of the rock is taken into account. Thereafter a numerical modelling of an underground gallery is presented based on this model. The role of the main construction characteristics, such as the rate of excavation and the delay for support installations, is finally discussed.},

Effect of support types and installation location in accordance with the convergence confinement method are incorporated in the analysis. The hyperbolic creep law is found to be more practical for simulation of closure response of squeezing ground than the power creep law because it is capable of modeling ground yielding around the tunnel when value of R f close to 1.0 is used. A parametric study is performed using the hyperbolic law and the results are discussed. Predicted tunnel closure was compared with the monitoring data from a number of tunnels and they were found in good agreement. It is found that the closure and support yielding time are most sensitive to the hyperbolic parameter E u I($\sigma$ 1 -$\sigma$ 3 ) f and creep parameter $\lambda$. The values of E u I($\sigma$1-$\sigma$3) f of 200-250 and $\lambda$ of 0.03-0.15 are found to be reasonable for most ground that exhibit squeezing. The analysis is useful in predicting time-dependent closure and support load for tunnels in both rocks and soils. {\textcopyright} 2007 ASCE.},

	abstract = {An advancing tunnel in deep saturated ground induces coupled interactions between transient fluid flow and deformation that affect the hydro-mechanical (H-M) response of the ground surrounding the excavation. The use of the convergence-confinement method (CCM) to simplify this three-dimensional (3-D) coupled problem into a 2-D plane strain model must then account for this transient coupling effect. Similarly, the induced radial displacement of the tunnel, commonly represented as the longitudinal displacement profile (LDP), will also be influenced by this time-dependent coupled interaction. This study investigates the effect of the transient H-M interaction on the practical implementation of the CCM and the LDP of an advancing tunnel in deep saturated ground. The tunnel is represented by a 2-D axisymmetric coupled H-M model that is built into the computer program Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) and is subjected to an isotropic in situ stress field. First, the study analyzes the induced pore pressure and deformation behavior during the excavation and standstill periods. Second, to account for the transient coupling effect, this study proposes: (1) nonlinear unloading factors for estimating excavation-induced pore pressure changes in CCM and (2) new LDP equations for predicting transient radial displacements along the axis of the tunnel. The resulting relationships from the two propositions are normalized, and thus, they should be applicable to other tunnel depths as well.},

This study emphasizes some important factors that influence the tunnel calculation, such as tunnel face, history of excavation phases, timing of the lining mounting, lining stiffness, and depth of the tunnel. The analytical approach is based on the determination and integration of the rock-lining interface differential equation.

	abstract = {The pressure acting on tunnel support structures generally increases with lapse in time. The pressure increase may be caused by not only the time-dependent mechanical properties of the underground medium, but also by the progression of the tunnel face. In order to clarify these two effects, three- dimensional analysis is required. In this study, however, a method which takes into account the three-dimensional effects of the tunnel face progression in two-dimensional plane strain analyses is proposed by introducing the ‘equivalent initial stress'. The proposed method can be easily applied to time-dependent analyses of the behaviour of tunnel support structures installed in a visco-elastic medium. The tunnels considered here are circular in shape, being driven in homogeneous isotropic linear visco-elastic media having hydrostatic initial stresses. In the first part of this paper, detailed discussions of the proposed equivalent initial stress are given. The second deals with the mathematical formulations for obtaining closed-form solutions for the pressure acting on tunnel support structures. In the third, numerical results and discussions are given, and special attention is paid to the effects of both the time-dependent mechanical properties of the material and the tunnel face progression. Finally, the theoretical results obtained here are utilized for inter- pretation of field measurements.},

	abstract = {Numerical analyses are performed on a routine basis in practical geotechnical engineering to assess the deformation behaviour of tunnels, in particular for near surface tunnels in soils when the influence on existing infrastructure such as buildings, deep foundations and adjacent tunnels has to be evaluated. In addition it becomes increasingly common to use results from numerical analysis as basis for designing the support measures for the tunnel. When doing so, the strongly nonlinear material behaviour of shotcrete, namely the increase of stiffness and strength with time, should be taken into account, in particular when the excavated cross section is subdivided in several construction stages involving temporary shotcrete structures with high stress concentrations near corners. In this paper a new constitutive model for shotcrete is applied in the numerical analysis of a complex underground railway station. It could be shown that significant differences in lining stresses are obtained when employing the newly developed constitutive model for shotcrete. However, the overall deformation behaviour is not significantly influenced by the shotcrete model},

	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing world wide. Although the majority of tunnel construction projects have been completed safely, there have been several incidents that have resulted in delays, cost overruns, and sometimes more significant consequences such as injury and loss of life. To help eliminate these accidents, it is necessary to systematically assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction. In order to better understand the conditions under which accidents occur, a database of 204 tunnel construction accidents was assembled. This is the most comprehensive database known to date. The database was analyzed to better understand the causes of accidents. Influence diagrams were constructed containing the main factors, and the interactions between them. These served as the basis of the risk assessment methodology presented in this work. The risk assessment methodology consists of combining a geologic prediction model that allows one to predict geology ahead of the tunnel construction, with a decision support model that allows one to choose amongst different construction strategies the one that leads to minimum risk. The geologic prediction model is based on Bayesian networks because of their ability to combine domain knowledge with data, encode dependencies among variables, and their ability to learn causal relationships.},

@phdthesis{Spackova2012,
	abstract = {Estimates of uncertainties and risks of the construction process are essential information for decision-making in infrastructure projects. The construction process is affected by different types of uncertainties. We can distinguish between the common variability of the construction process and the uncertainty on occurrence of extraordinary events, also denoted as failures of the construction process. In tunnel construction, a significant part of the uncertainty results from the unknown geotechnical conditions. The construction performance is further influenced by human and organizational factors, whose effect is not known in advance. All these uncertainties should be taken into account when modelling the uncertainty and risk of the tunnel construction. For reliable predictions, it is essential to realistically estimate the parameters of the probabilistic model. At present, such estimates mostly rely on expert judgement. However, these can be strongly biased and unreliable. Therefore, the expert estimates should be supported by analysis of data from previous projects. This thesis attempts to address these issues. First, it introduces a simple probabilistic model for the estimation of the delay due to occurrence of construction failures. The model is applied to a case study, which demonstrates, how the probabilistic estimate of construction delay can be used for assessing the risk and for making decisions. Second, advanced model including both the common variability and construction failures using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) is presented. This model takes over some modelling procedures from existing models but it extends the scope of the modelled uncertainties. The model is applied to two case studies for the estimation of tunnel construction time. It is demonstrated, how observations from the tunnel construction process can be included to continuously update the prediction of excavation time. Third, an efficient algorithm for the evaluation of the proposed DBN is developed. A modification to the existing Frontier algorithm is suggested, denoted as modified Frontier algorithm. This new algorithm is efficient for evaluating DBNs with cumulative variables. Fourth, performance data from tunnels constructed in the past are analysed. The data motivates the development of a novel combined probability distribution to describe the excavation performance. In addition, the probability of construction failure and the delay caused by such failures is estimated using databases available in the literature. Additionally, a brief database of tunnel projects and tunnel construction failures from the Czech Republic is compiled. The database includes basic information on all tunnels, which have been constructed in the Czech Republic since 1989. The database of failures, which occurred in the analysed tunnels, contains 17 events, mostly cave-in collapses. The models presented in this thesis are applied to the estimation of tunnel construction time. The construction costs can be assessed analogously by replacing the time variables with cost variables. The costs can also be modelled as a function of the construction time. The statistical analysis of data presented in the thesis provides a valuable input for probabilistic prediction of construction time in infrastructure projects. The results of the case studies seem to realistically reflect the uncertainty of the construction time estimates.},

A rheological model is discussed that accounts for visco-elastic (primary) and visco-plastic (sec-ondary) contributions to rock creep. The effects of tertiary creep are included in the model by way of a gradual mechanical damage governed by the cumulated visco-plastic strains. The parameters of the intact rock are first identified based on laboratory test results presented in the literature. Then, after scaling them to those of the rock mass, the potential applicability of the model is tested through axisymmetric and plane strain finite element analyses of the full face excavation of a deep circular tunnel. The results are discussed with particular reference to the short term redistribution of stresses around the opening and to its convergence. The analyses show the relevant influence of tertiary creep on the tunnel closure. In addition, those based on an axisymmetric scheme turn out to be crucial for the correct long term prediction of the interaction between the rock mass and the supporting structure of the opening.},

A generalized derivation procedure for any viscoelastic model is presented accounting for the sequential excavation of a circular tunnel supported by any number of liners of different thicknesses and stiffnesses installed at different times in a viscoelastic surrounding rock under a hydrostatic stress field under plane strain axisymmetric conditions. Sequential excavation was accounted for assuming the radius of the tunnel growing from an initial value to a final one according to a time-dependent function to be prescribed by the designer. The effect of tunnel advancement was also considered. For the generalized Kelvin viscoelastic model, explicit analytical closed form solutions were presented, which can be reduced to the solutions for the Maxwell and Kelvin models.An extensive parametric analysis was then performed to investigate the effect of the excavation process adopted, the rheological properties of the rock, stiffness, thickness and installation times of the liners on tunnel convergence, pressure on the liners and on the stress field in the rock for a support system made of three liners. Several dimensionless charts for ease of use of practitioners were provided. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Wong2008,
	abstract = {This paper is interested in the hydro-mechanical behaviour of an underground cavity abandoned at the end of its service life. It is an extension of a previous study that accounted for a poro-elastic behaviour of the rock mass (Int. J. Comput. Geomech. 2007; DOI: 10.1016/ j.compgeo.2007.11.003). Deterioration of the lining support with time leads to the transfer of the loading from the exterior massif to the interior backfill. The in situ material has a poro-visco-elastic constitutive behaviour while the backfill is poroelastic, both saturated with water. This loading transfer is accompanied by an inward cavity convergence, thereby compressing the backfill, and induces an outward water flow. This leads to a complex space-time evolution of pore pressures, displacements and stresses, which is not always intuitive. In its general setting, a semi-explicit solution to this problem is developed, using Laplace transform, the inversion being performed numerically. Analytical inversion leading to a quasi-explicit solution in the time domain is possible by identifying the characteristic creep and relaxation times of volumetric strains with those of the deviatoric strains, on the basis of a parametric study. A few numerical examples are given to illustrate the hydro-mechanical behaviour of the cavity and highlight the influence of key parameters (e.g. stiffness of backfill, lining deterioration rate, etc.). Further studies accounting for more general material behaviours for the backfill and external ground are ongoing. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

By using 3D nonlinear finite element method, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation process is dynamically simulated to analyze the stress and strain field status of surrounding rock and segment. The maximum tensile stress of segment ring caused by tunnel construction mainly lies in arch bottom and presents zonal distribution. The stress increases slightly and limitedly in the course of excavation. The maximum and minimum displacements of segment, manifesting as zonal distribution, distribute in arch bottom and vault respectively. The displacements slightly increase with the advance of TBM and gradually tend to stability. Precast concrete segment linings are the main load-bearing structure in tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnel , whose mechanical performance has a direct impact on tunnel safety. The correct mechanical analysis of segment linings is important to the design of TBM tunnel. At present, stability analysis of segment lining used in water conveyance delivery tunnel with TBM excavation has no unified calculation model and analysis method. Compared with TBM, shield method has been applied widely in the construction of urban subways and other traffic facilities. Structural stability of tunnel excavation with shield method has been developed at home and abroad [1-15]. Aiming at the deep tunnel construction with TBM, using 3D nonlinear finite element method, this paper establishes a 3D finite element simulation model to dynamically simulate TBM digging process and analyze the stability of wall rock and segment.},

	abstract = {：In most studies of tunnel boring machine(TBM)tunnelling, the groundwater pressure was not considered , or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure. Meanwhile, the leakage, which mainly occurs in the segment joints, was often ignored in the relevant studies of TBM tunnelling. Additionally, the geological models in these studies were simplified to different extents, and mostly were simplified as homogenous bodies. Considering the deficiencies above, a 3D refined model of the surrounding rock of a tunnel is firstly established using NURBS-TIN-BReP hybrid data structure in this paper. Then the seepage field of the surrounding rock considering the leakage in the segment joints is simulated. Finally, the stability of TBM water diversion tunnel is studied coupled with the seepage simulation, to analyze the stress-strain conditions, the axial force and the bending moment of tunnel segment considering the leakage in the segment joints. The results illustrate that the maximum radial displacement, the minimum principal stress, the maximum principal stress and the axial force of segment lining considering the seepage effect are all larger than those disregarding the seepage effect. Keywords：segment lining; seepage-stress coupling; 3D geological model; TBM water diversion tunnel Today, almost all rock mass conditions can be bored by modern tunnel boring machines(TBMs)with the tunnel diameter varying from less than 3 m to more than 15 m. The TBMs are among the most technically sophisticated excavation machines in tunnelling industry [1]. The wide application leads to the deep research on the TBM construction technology, and many achievements have been made in construction simulation, structural stability analysis and groundwater pressure calculation. However, in many relevant studies the groundwater pressure was not considered, or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure [2-4] , which is inconsistent with engineering practices and unsafe [5]. The simulation results are more reasonable if the groundwater pressure is exerted as body force, and the seepage-stress coupling calculation can achieve more reliable expression for tunnel stability. The applications of seepage-stress coupling analysis in tunnel engineering are increasingly wide spread [6-10] , and many achievements have been made. However, most researches were concentrated on solving the settlement and deformation problem. Only a few studies took the groundwater pressure as body force by coupling the seepage field in the stability analysis model to study the groundwater effect. Meanwhile, the tunnel linings in the above studies were treated as impervious materials or homogeneous porous materials due to the limitation of simulation method. Wongsaroj et al [11] found there were great differences between the measured pore pressure and numerical simulation results when the shield tunnel lining was treated as uniform permeability. Shin [12] pointed out that the leakage of shield tunnel occurs mainly in partial locations such as segment joints and bolt holes. Therefore, the numerical simulation results will reflect engineering practices better if the leakage of shield tunnel is considered to occur in partial locations. But the relative studies are still rare at present, and},
