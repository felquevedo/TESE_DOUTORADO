@article{Barla2010,
	abstract = {This paper deals with full face excavation of large size tunnels in rock masses of very poor quality which exhibit squeezing behaviour. Time dependence is accounted for explicitly by using constitutive models which have been validated with reference to laboratory testing and in situ performance monitoring. The case study of the Saint Martin La Porte access adit (Lyon-Turin Base Tunnel) is taken as illustration. In this adit an innovative excavation-construction method is being used to cope with the severely squeezing Carboniferous zone encountered. An essential feature of this method is a two-stage excavation sequence with installation of a composite pre-reinforcement/reinforcement system with deformable elements embedded in the shotcrete lining. The tunnel response has been analysed by both semi-analytical and numerical solutions with close attention paid to the constitutive models adopted. Results of modelling are compared with convergence monitoring data.},

@article{Chakeri2011,
	abstract = {Tunnels are increasingly being excavated in soft ground conditions when services are required in urban environments, and it is now common to have tunnels crossing at various elevations. As the tunnel excavations are undertaken at different levels, there will be an interaction which can have a significant influence on stress distribu- tions and consequently deformations within the tunnels and surface settlement. As multi-layer tunnelling is a three dimensional phenomenon in nature, 3D numerical solutions must be utilized for perpendicularly crossing tunnels at various levels. This paper reports the investigations into the changes in stress distribution, deformations and surface settlements which may be expected when the twin Tohid Tunnels pass beneath the Line 4 metro tunnel in Tehran.},

@incollection{Chan2008,
	abstract = {A numerical method for the calculation of the overall behaviour of a non-trivial three-dimensional saturated soil-structure system is presented in this paper. The numerical modelling of saturated soil is discussed in detail together with comparisons with soil-structure physical experiments performed on the centrifuge facilities at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for the VELACS project.
	In order to model the saturated soil, three main components are needed for the numerical simulation and they are as follows:
	
	The establishment of an adequate mathematical framework to describe the phenomenon
	The establishment of a numerical (discrete) approximation procedure
	The establishment of an adequate constitutive relationship for the material behaviour
	The numerical procedure employs the Biot formulation as the basic mathematical framework, the Finite Element method for spatial discretisation and the Generalised Newmark scheme for time stepping [1]. The u-p formulation is used with displacement (u) and pore pressure (p) as the primary unknowns and the constitutive relationship used is the Pastor-Zienkiewicz mark III model [2].
	
	The numerical procedure is validated using Test No.12 from the VELACS [3] experiments, is a dynamic three-dimensional soil-structure interaction test with a model of a structure in the form of a block being placed on a saturated sand layer overlaid by a thin silt layer and subjected to earthquake-like base motion. The tests were performed at 100g centrifugal acceleration at Princeton University, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and University of California, Davis [4].
	
	Very good comparisons with the results from the physical centrifuges test had been obtained. All the accelerations predicted were in good agreement with the measured values. Very good comparisons were also obtained for most of the pore water pressure transducers though in some locations, the level of excess pore pressure rise was slightly lower than that measured. Around 10cm settlement was predicted by the numerical analysis which is between the value obtained at UC Davis (9cm) and RPI (13cm). But a very wide spread of the measured vertical settlement was observed therefore the measured final settlement value may not be too trustworthy for comparison purposes however the numerical prediction correctly modelled the trend at which the settlement developed.
	
	These results confirmed that the assumptions and the approximation used in the numerical procedure are sound and further analyses on various three-dimensional examples and further investigations on the use of iterative solvers instead of the direct solver used in this study are underway.},

@article{Do2014,
	abstract = {The increase in transportation in large cities makes it necessary to construct of twin tunnels at shallow depths. Thus, the prediction of the influence of a new tunnel construction on an already existing one plays a key role in the optimal design and construction of close parallel shield tunnels in order to avoid any damage to the existing tunnel during and after excavation of the new tunnel.Most of the reported cases in the literature on parallel mechanized excavation of twin tunnels have focused on the effects of the ground condition, tunnel size, tunnel depth, surface loads, and relative position between the two tunnels on tunnel behaviour. The numerical investigation performed in this study, using the FLAC3D finite difference element programme, has made it possible to include the influence of the construction process between the two tunnels. The structural forces induced in both tunnels and the development of the displacement field in the surrounding ground have been highlighted.The results of the numerical analysis have indicated a great impact of a new tunnel construction on an existing tunnel. The influence of the lagged distance between the two tunnels faces has also been highlighted. Generally, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels causes smaller structural forces and lining displacements than those induced in the case of twin tunnels excavated at a large lagged distance. However, the simultaneous excavation of twin tunnels could result in a higher settlement above the two tunnels. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Manchao2015,
	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing worldwide in mining and civil engineering. There have been several accidents that resulted in delays, cost overruns, some with more severe consequences. To help minimize these accidents, it is necessary to assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction and exploration. A particular type of accident, or undesirable event, which can occur during tunnel construction and operation, is associated with the occurrence of excessive deformations occurring inside the tunnel. This can happen due to deficient design, construction defects, and high in situ stresses or due to specific swelling and squeezing grounds. Deep coal mines where large deformations can occur during and after excavations due to the soft properties of the rock and the high in situ stresses, are particularly vulnerable to this type of event. The associated non-linear problems are related with geomechanical behavior of the rock mass, changes in the geometry of cavities and in some cases with developing surface contacts due to large strains. In this paper, the phenomena involved in large material deformations are analyzed in detail and the basic equations for the Chen's large deformation theory are presented. The application of an FEM based method to simulate large material deformations, the Material Point Method (MPM) to the simulation of large deformation that occurs in tunnels when failure occurs, is also described. An application of MPM to the Jiahe Coal Mine, in China is presented, and the numerical results obtained with MPM compared with solutions using Chen's large deformation theory. Safety considerations about the excessive deformation scenario in tunnels are drawn and a risk assessment methodology with special use of Bayesian networks is proposed. A simplified schematic example was presented for two case scenarios.},

This is particularly true for tunnels excavated in soft rock which could sustain large deformations. In this context, the forecast and the assessment of the behaviour of the rock mass during the tunnel's construction stages, as well as in the long term, require numerical modelling with the use of appropriate constitutive models. In this paper, current models which are based on the viscoplasticity coupled to the damage theory are presented. They enable the computing of creep strains, stress relaxation and possibly, time at failure, if the damage process of the rock is taken into account. Thereafter a numerical modelling of an underground gallery is presented based on this model. The role of the main construction characteristics, such as the rate of excavation and the delay for support installations, is finally discussed.},

The nomograms make it possible to assess the feasibility of a TBM drive in a given geotechnical situation and to evaluate potential design measures or operational measures such as reductions in shield length, the installation of a higher thrust force, increases in the overcut or the lubrication of the shield surface, thus making a valuable contribution to the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of one or two decimetres may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. This paper sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions; secondly to analyse the factors governing TBM performance by means of a structured examination of the multiple interfaces and interactions between ground, tunnelling equipment and support; and thirdly to provide a critical review of the technical options existing or proposed for coping with squeezing ground in mechanized tunnelling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Roatesi2014,
	abstract = {This paper presents both a numerical and an analytical approach for tunnel excavation and support mounting. The three-dimensional aspect of the tunnel face advance and the lining installation is simulated by a two-dimensional study assuming the hypothesis of gradual decompression of the primary stress on the outline of the tunnel. The numerical approach consists of a tunnel axis in an elasto-viscoplastic rock mass and a concrete elastic lining. This study emphasizes some important factors that influence the tunnel calculation, such as tunnel face, history of excavation phases, timing of the lining mounting, lining stiffness, and depth of the tunnel. The analytical approach is based on the determination and integration of the rock-lining interface differential equation. The author presents the analytical solution for (a) constant and non-constant lining pressure, and (b) taking into account the tunnel face influence. The comparison of the numerical results with the analytical solution is performed, and a good agreement is obtained. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Schweiger2014,
	abstract = {Numerical analyses are performed on a routine basis in practical geotechnical engineering to assess the deformation behaviour of tunnels, in particular for near surface tunnels in soils when the influence on existing infrastructure such as buildings, deep foundations and adjacent tunnels has to be evaluated. In addition it becomes increasingly common to use results from numerical analysis as basis for designing the support measures for the tunnel. When doing so, the strongly nonlinear material behaviour of shotcrete, namely the increase of stiffness and strength with time, should be taken into account, in particular when the excavated cross section is subdivided in several construction stages involving temporary shotcrete structures with high stress concentrations near corners. In this paper a new constitutive model for shotcrete is applied in the numerical analysis of a complex underground railway station. It could be shown that significant differences in lining stresses are obtained when employing the newly developed constitutive model for shotcrete. However, the overall deformation behaviour is not significantly influenced by the shotcrete model},

	abstract = {：Applying stiffness migration method, a 3D finite element mechanical model is established to simulate the excavation and advance processes. By using 3D nonlinear finite element method, the tunnel boring machine (TBM) excavation process is dynamically simulated to analyze the stress and strain field status of surrounding rock and segment. The maximum tensile stress of segment ring caused by tunnel construction mainly lies in arch bottom and presents zonal distribution. The stress increases slightly and limitedly in the course of excavation. The maximum and minimum displacements of segment, manifesting as zonal distribution, distribute in arch bottom and vault respectively. The displacements slightly increase with the advance of TBM and gradually tend to stability. Precast concrete segment linings are the main load-bearing structure in tunnel boring machine (TBM) tunnel , whose mechanical performance has a direct impact on tunnel safety. The correct mechanical analysis of segment linings is important to the design of TBM tunnel. At present, stability analysis of segment lining used in water conveyance delivery tunnel with TBM excavation has no unified calculation model and analysis method. Compared with TBM, shield method has been applied widely in the construction of urban subways and other traffic facilities. Structural stability of tunnel excavation with shield method has been developed at home and abroad [1-15]. Aiming at the deep tunnel construction with TBM, using 3D nonlinear finite element method, this paper establishes a 3D finite element simulation model to dynamically simulate TBM digging process and analyze the stability of wall rock and segment.},

@article{Zhong2016,
	abstract = {：In most studies of tunnel boring machine(TBM)tunnelling, the groundwater pressure was not considered , or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure. Meanwhile, the leakage, which mainly occurs in the segment joints, was often ignored in the relevant studies of TBM tunnelling. Additionally, the geological models in these studies were simplified to different extents, and mostly were simplified as homogenous bodies. Considering the deficiencies above, a 3D refined model of the surrounding rock of a tunnel is firstly established using NURBS-TIN-BReP hybrid data structure in this paper. Then the seepage field of the surrounding rock considering the leakage in the segment joints is simulated. Finally, the stability of TBM water diversion tunnel is studied coupled with the seepage simulation, to analyze the stress-strain conditions, the axial force and the bending moment of tunnel segment considering the leakage in the segment joints. The results illustrate that the maximum radial displacement, the minimum principal stress, the maximum principal stress and the axial force of segment lining considering the seepage effect are all larger than those disregarding the seepage effect. Keywords：segment lining; seepage-stress coupling; 3D geological model; TBM water diversion tunnel Today, almost all rock mass conditions can be bored by modern tunnel boring machines(TBMs)with the tunnel diameter varying from less than 3 m to more than 15 m. The TBMs are among the most technically sophisticated excavation machines in tunnelling industry [1]. The wide application leads to the deep research on the TBM construction technology, and many achievements have been made in construction simulation, structural stability analysis and groundwater pressure calculation. However, in many relevant studies the groundwater pressure was not considered, or was simplified and exerted on the boundary of lining structure [2-4] , which is inconsistent with engineering practices and unsafe [5]. The simulation results are more reasonable if the groundwater pressure is exerted as body force, and the seepage-stress coupling calculation can achieve more reliable expression for tunnel stability. The applications of seepage-stress coupling analysis in tunnel engineering are increasingly wide spread [6-10] , and many achievements have been made. However, most researches were concentrated on solving the settlement and deformation problem. Only a few studies took the groundwater pressure as body force by coupling the seepage field in the stability analysis model to study the groundwater effect. Meanwhile, the tunnel linings in the above studies were treated as impervious materials or homogeneous porous materials due to the limitation of simulation method. Wongsaroj et al [11] found there were great differences between the measured pore pressure and numerical simulation results when the shield tunnel lining was treated as uniform permeability. Shin [12] pointed out that the leakage of shield tunnel occurs mainly in partial locations such as segment joints and bolt holes. Therefore, the numerical simulation results will reflect engineering practices better if the leakage of shield tunnel is considered to occur in partial locations. But the relative studies are still rare at present, and},
