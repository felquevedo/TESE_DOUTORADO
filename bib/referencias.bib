@article{Barla2010,
	abstract = {This paper deals with full face excavation of large size tunnels in rock masses of very poor quality which exhibit squeezing behaviour. Time dependence is accounted for explicitly by using constitutive models which have been validated with reference to laboratory testing and in situ performance monitoring. The case study of the Saint Martin La Porte access adit (Lyon-Turin Base Tunnel) is taken as illustration. In this adit an innovative excavation-construction method is being used to cope with the severely squeezing Carboniferous zone encountered. An essential feature of this method is a two-stage excavation sequence with installation of a composite pre-reinforcement/reinforcement system with deformable elements embedded in the shotcrete lining. The tunnel response has been analysed by both semi-analytical and numerical solutions with close attention paid to the constitutive models adopted. Results of modelling are compared with convergence monitoring data.},

	abstract = {The increased use of underground space for transportation systems and the increasing complexity and constraints of constructing and maintaining above ground transportation infrastructure have prompted the need to develop this technical manual. This FHWA manual is intended to be a single-source technical manual providing guidelines for planning, design, construction and rehabilitation of road tunnels, and encompasses various types of road tunnels including mined, bored, cut-and-cover, immersed, and jacked box tunnels. The scope of the manual is primarily limited to the civil elements of road tunnels. The development of this technical manual has been funded by the National Highway Institute, and supported by Parsons Brinckerhoff, as well as numerous authors and reviewers.},

@article{Manchao2015,
	abstract = {Tunnel construction is increasing worldwide in mining and civil engineering. There have been several accidents that resulted in delays, cost overruns, some with more severe consequences. To help minimize these accidents, it is necessary to assess and manage the risks associated with tunnel construction and exploration. A particular type of accident, or undesirable event, which can occur during tunnel construction and operation, is associated with the occurrence of excessive deformations occurring inside the tunnel. This can happen due to deficient design, construction defects, and high in situ stresses or due to specific swelling and squeezing grounds. Deep coal mines where large deformations can occur during and after excavations due to the soft properties of the rock and the high in situ stresses, are particularly vulnerable to this type of event. The associated non-linear problems are related with geomechanical behavior of the rock mass, changes in the geometry of cavities and in some cases with developing surface contacts due to large strains. In this paper, the phenomena involved in large material deformations are analyzed in detail and the basic equations for the Chen's large deformation theory are presented. The application of an FEM based method to simulate large material deformations, the Material Point Method (MPM) to the simulation of large deformation that occurs in tunnels when failure occurs, is also described. An application of MPM to the Jiahe Coal Mine, in China is presented, and the numerical results obtained with MPM compared with solutions using Chen's large deformation theory. Safety considerations about the excessive deformation scenario in tunnels are drawn and a risk assessment methodology with special use of Bayesian networks is proposed. A simplified schematic example was presented for two case scenarios.},

@article{Ramoni2010a,
	abstract = {Rapidly converging ground may exert such a high pressure on the shield that the thrust force is no longer sufficient to overcome shield skin friction and the TBM becomes jammed. This paper advances a number of theory-based decision aids, which will support rapid, initial assessments to be made of thrust force requirements. A comprehensive parametric study has been carried out using the finite element method and, based on the numerical results, dimensionless design nomograms have been worked out that cover the relevant range of material constants, in situ stress and TBM characteristics. The nomograms make it possible to assess the feasibility of a TBM drive in a given geotechnical situation and to evaluate potential design measures or operational measures such as reductions in shield length, the installation of a higher thrust force, increases in the overcut or the lubrication of the shield surface, thus making a valuable contribution to the decision-making process. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Ramoni2010b,
	abstract = {Squeezing ground represents a challenging operating environment as it may slow down or obstruct TBM operation. Due to the geometrical constraints of the equipment, relatively small convergences of one or two decimetres may lead to considerable difficulties in the machine area (sticking of the cutter head, jamming of the shield) or in the back-up area (e.g., jamming of the back-up equipment, inadmissible convergences of the bored profile, damage to the tunnel support). Depending on the number and the length of the critical stretches, squeezing conditions may even call into question the feasibility of a TBM drive. This paper sets out firstly to give an overview of the specific problems of TBM tunnelling under squeezing conditions; secondly to analyse the factors governing TBM performance by means of a structured examination of the multiple interfaces and interactions between ground, tunnelling equipment and support; and thirdly to provide a critical review of the technical options existing or proposed for coping with squeezing ground in mechanized tunnelling. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
